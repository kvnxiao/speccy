# speccy-review

Runs one round of adversarial review on one task per invocation and
exits. With an optional `[SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN]` selector argument, the
session reviews that specific task. Without an argument, the session
resolves the next reviewable task via `speccy next --json` (workspace
form — used here because no SPEC is known on the no-selector path) and reviews
that one. Task state lives in the `state` attribute on each `<task>`
XML element in TASKS.md; review activity prose lives in the sibling
`.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/journal/T-NNN.md` file, never inside the
`<task>` body.

This is a single-task primitive. It does not iterate over the
remaining `in-review` tasks; composition across tasks belongs to a
caller (a human at the terminal, the `/loop` skill, or a future
orchestrator).

Within the one task under review, the skill fans out to four
parallel persona sub-agents (default fan-out: `business`, `tests`,
`security`, `style`). That fan-out is intrinsic to the primitive —
adversarial diversity comes from fresh contexts per persona — and is
bounded to one round of four sub-agents on one task.

Because sub-agents cannot spawn sub-agents, this skill must run in a
context that **is** the top-level session — either a human
invocation (`speccy-review …`) where the host CLI
itself runs the skill body, or the
`speccy-orchestrate` outer loop which inlines this
skill body into its own session at the `review` dispatch (it cannot
delegate to a wrapper sub-agent that would then try to spawn the
four persona leaves).

## When to use

- With a selector (`speccy-review SPEC-NNNN/T-003`):
  when the task to review is already known.
- Without an argument: when picking up wherever `TASKS.md` left off.
  The session reviews one task and exits.

The target task must already be in `state="in-review"` (typically
flipped there by `speccy-work`).

## Steps

**Entry precondition (REQ-007, REQ-008):** before resolving the target task, query `speccy next --json` (per-spec form when a selector was passed, workspace form otherwise). If the returned envelope's `next_action.kind == "reconcile"`, dispatch the reconcile pass per the **Reconcile policy** summary below (canonical policy at `.agents/speccy-references/reconcile-policy.md`) instead of running the normal review flow. Re-query after the pass; resume normal dispatch only when `consistency.status == "ok"`.

**Reconcile policy.** When `speccy next --json` returns `next_action.kind == "reconcile"`, iterate `consistency.drifts[]` and apply the table action per entry, then re-query before proceeding. See `.agents/speccy-references/reconcile-policy.md` for the full policy table, the three properties the dispatch holds by construction (autonomous / rollback-biased / idempotent), and the extension protocol for adding new drift kinds.

### Resolve the target task

- If a `SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN` selector was passed, that is the target.
- Otherwise, query the CLI in workspace form (no SPEC selector
  is known on this no-selector invocation path — we must walk
  the active tree to find a reviewable task):

  ```bash
  # workspace form: no SPEC-NNNN known yet; scan the active tree.
  speccy next --json
  ```

  Workspace-form exit-code-stop contract: exit code 2 with a
  top-level `reason="no_active_specs"` field in the JSON envelope
  means the workspace has no active specs at all. Exit gracefully
  and surface the reason; do not treat the non-zero exit as a CLI
  error.

  On exit code 0, if the resulting `specs` array has no entry with
  `next_action.kind == "review"`, exit and report that no
  reviewable tasks remain. Otherwise, construct the disambiguated
  `<spec>/<task>` form from the JSON's `spec_id` and
  `next_action.task_id` fields (the bare task ID is ambiguous
  across specs — every spec has its own `T-001`).

  Exit-code-stop contract: once SPEC-NNNN is resolved, any
  subsequent per-spec query (`speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json`) that
  exits non-zero means the SPEC has reached a terminal state —
  halt and surface the stderr line. Only parse JSON when exit
  code is 0.

### Run the persona fan-out and consolidation

Shared with the `speccy-orchestrate` review
dispatch — both this skill body and that dispatch step include the
same partial below so the fan-out contract has a single source of
truth.


Fan out five reviewer-* sub-agents in parallel against the resolved
task, one per persona. Default fan-out: `reviewer-business`,
`reviewer-tests`, `reviewer-security`, `reviewer-style`,
`reviewer-correctness`. Two additional personas
(`reviewer-architecture`, `reviewer-docs`) are off the default
fan-out and are invoked explicitly when an architectural or
documentation risk is suspected.

The prompt for each spawn is:

> Review task `SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN`. Open your per-task context read with a
> single `speccy context SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN --json` call — the bundle
> carries the task entry, its covering requirements and scenarios, the
> full per-task journal (prior implementer handoffs, review verdicts,
> and blockers), the sibling index, the file paths, and a suggested
> merge-base diff command. Read the diff with that command, then apply
> your persona's review criteria. Targeted follow-up reads via the
> bundle's listed paths (e.g. the evidence file) remain legitimate
> where your persona needs something outside the bundle. Append your
> own `<review>` block to the
> per-task journal by running
> `speccy journal append SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN --block review --persona <persona> --verdict <pass|blocking> --model <your-model>`
> with the review body on stdin, then return a thin self-closing
> `<verdict persona="<persona>" verdict="..." model="..." rationale="..." />`
> element as your final message (per the verdict-return contract). The
> `--model` value is required and must identify the model that produced
> the verdict (with the optional slash-suffix effort convention from the
> verdict-return contract). Do not edit TASKS.md. The journal write goes
> through `speccy journal append` — do not use file-editing tools on the
> journal.
>
> The working tree may be dirty: the implementer leaves changes
> uncommitted on purpose, and the orchestrator (not the implementer)
> owns the single atomic commit on review pass per REQ-003/REQ-004.
> On retry rounds the dirty tree is the prior pass's WIP that the
> retry implementer amended in place per the retry-shape contract.
> Do not flag uncommitted state, commit timing, or "changes not
> committed before the in-review flip" -- those are out of scope
> for per-task review.

Substitute the resolved `SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN` and the persona name per
spawn.

Invoke Codex's native sub-agent-spawn primitive five times in
parallel against the registered Codex sub-agents
`reviewer-business`, `reviewer-tests`, `reviewer-security`,
`reviewer-style`, and `reviewer-correctness`. Each persona's TOML
file at `.codex/agents/reviewer-<persona>.toml` carries the
sub-agent's developer instructions.

Canonical journal `<review>` shape:
`.agents/speccy-references/journal-review.md`.

Canonical journal `<blockers>` shape:
`.agents/speccy-references/journal-blockers.md`.

Each reviewer sub-agent appends its own `<review>` block to
`.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/journal/T-NNN.md` via `speccy journal
append --block review` before returning a thin `<verdict>` element
(see `resources/modules/personas/verdict_return_contract.md`). The
CLI's per-file lock serializes those parallel appends, so the
running session never transcribes `<review>` blocks itself and never
edits the journal with file-editing tools. The orchestrator's job
after the fan-out settles is to **verify completeness, read back any
blockers, then drive the state flip through the CLI verbs**.

### Step 1 — verify the round's reviews are complete

Read back the appended `<review>` blocks for the round under review
through the CLI rather than trusting the returned thin verdicts:

```bash
speccy journal show SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN --json --block review --round latest
```

Confirm every persona you spawned appears in the result for the
latest round. If a persona is missing (its append failed, or its
sub-agent errored before appending), halt the fan-out and surface
the missing persona rather than flipping state on an incomplete
round. Do not parse the journal file by hand — `journal show` is the
read-back authority.

### Step 2 — drive the state flip through `speccy task transition`

Decide pass vs blocking from the verdicts the reviewers appended,
then flip the task's `state` with the transition command — never by
editing the `state` attribute in TASKS.md directly:

- If every spawned reviewer's appended `<review verdict="...">` is
  `verdict="pass"`, flip `in-review` → `completed`:

      speccy task transition SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN --to completed

- If any spawned reviewer's `<review verdict="...">` is
  `verdict="blocking"`, flip `in-review` → `pending`:

      speccy task transition SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN --to pending

  then append a single consolidated `<blockers>` block (step 3).

### Step 3 — consolidate blockers via `speccy journal append`

On a blocking round, read back the failing reviews and write **one**
consolidated `<blockers>` block — not one per reviewer, not a partial
write. Read the blocking review bodies through the CLI:

```bash
speccy journal show SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN --json --verdict blocking --round latest
```

The `<blockers>` **body is orchestrator-authored semantic judgment**
(DEC-001 non-goal: the CLI never synthesizes blocker prose). Compose
the body from the blocking reviews you just read back, then append it
with the body on stdin:

```bash
speccy journal append SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN --block blockers <<'EOF'
<one-line summary of what to change before the next implementer pass>.
<optional bullets enumerating each persona's blocker>.
EOF
```

The CLI is the sole authority for the block's `date` and `round` and
emits the paired `<blockers>…</blockers>` element — **do not compute,
supply, or hand-author `date`, `round`, or the open/close tags**.
There is no flag to override them; the body you pipe is the inner
text only. Validation runs before any write; a malformed body leaves
the journal byte-identical.

The single-writer rule holds: the CLI's append lock owns write
serialization across the parallel reviewer appends and this
consolidated `<blockers>` append, and the orchestrator remains the
sole author of `<blockers>` bodies (and, per the commit step below,
of git commits). The running session issues only CLI verbs — `journal
show`, `journal append`, `task transition` — for the review-induced
journal and state writes; it never edits TASKS.md or the journal file
with file-editing tools.

### Atomic commit on review pass (REQ-003, REQ-004)

When every spawned reviewer returned `verdict="pass"` and the
`speccy task transition … --to completed` flip has run (the reviewer
`<review>` appends already landed via the CLI during the fan-out),
the running session performs the commit step using the shared commit
recipe below. The commit captures the implementer's code changes, the
TASKS.md state flip, and the journal append in a single atomic commit
(parent count = 1).

Supply the recipe's two behaviour-varying parameters as follows:

- **Staging breadth: `git add -A`.** Stage everything in the working
  tree. Do not stage selectively — `git add -A` is sound under the
  clean-tree precondition (REQ-002) that fires at the start of work
  dispatch, which guarantees every dirty path at commit time is
  task-scoped.
- **Title and body.**
  - **Title:** `[SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN]: <task title>` — `<task title>` is
    read verbatim from the `<task>` element's `## ` heading in
    TASKS.md (the one-line H2 immediately after the `<task ...>`
    opening tag). Substitute the resolved spec and task IDs. This
    title prefix is the sole task-identity link in git history; the
    consistency check correlates commits to tasks by grepping for it.
  - **Body:** the trimmed content of the `Completed` field from the
    latest `<implementer>` block in the per-task journal file. Extract
    mechanically as the bytes between the `- Completed:` bullet marker
    and the next `- <Field>:` bullet marker (one of `Undone`,
    `Hygiene checks`, `Evidence`, `Discovered issues`,
    `Procedural compliance`). Trim leading and trailing whitespace.

With those two parameters fixed, run the shared recipe — it defines
the no-git short-circuit, the unified stage-then-`git diff --cached
--quiet` idempotency check (a clean working tree skips the commit
silently, matching the prior behaviour), the `Co-Authored-By` trailer,
and the HEREDOC commit mechanics:

## Shared commit recipe

This module is the single source of truth for how a skill turns a
just-written artifact into a git commit. Each callsite pulls it in with
a MiniJinja `include` directive naming
`modules/references/commit-recipe.md`; there is no verbatim copy of this
recipe in any individual skill body.

The caller supplies two — and only two — behaviour-varying parameters:

- **Staging breadth.** Either `git add -A` (stage everything in the
  working tree) or a narrow `git add <paths>` list (stage exactly the
  named paths, leaving unrelated dirty paths untouched). The caller's
  prose states which form applies and why.
- **Title and body.** The commit message title line and body, built by
  the caller from its own artifact (e.g. a `[SPEC-NNNN]:`-prefixed
  title and a body drawn from the artifact's frontmatter or journal).

Everything else — the no-git short-circuit, the idempotency check, the
trailer, and the HEREDOC mechanics — is identical for every caller and
is defined once here.

### No-git short-circuit

Before staging anything, check whether the working directory is inside
a git repository:

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
```

If this exits non-zero (the project is not a git repository), **skip
the entire commit step without erroring**. The just-written artifact is
left in place on disk; no commit is attempted and no git failure is
surfaced. This preserves Speccy's "works identically in any project
state" property for non-git projects.

### Stage, then skip-if-empty, then commit

When a git repository is present:

1. **Stage** using the caller's chosen breadth — `git add -A` or the
   narrow `git add <paths>` list. Staging unchanged content is a no-op,
   so a narrow caller may pass its full path set unconditionally
   regardless of whether some of those paths were already committed.

2. **Idempotency check** — run the single unified form:

   ```bash
   git diff --cached --quiet
   ```

   If exit code is 0 (nothing staged), **skip the commit silently** —
   the configured paths are already committed at their current content.
   No surface to the user, no error. This is the only idempotency
   check; do not substitute a pre-stage `git status --porcelain`
   variant. If exit code is non-zero, proceed to the commit.

3. **Commit** with the caller's title and body, passing the message via
   a HEREDOC so newlines and any special characters survive verbatim:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <caller title>

   <caller body>

   Co-Authored-By: <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

   The commit is single-parent (parent count = 1). The skill body does
   not check or change the current git branch; the commit lands on
   whatever HEAD is.

### Trailer

The `Co-Authored-By` trailer is resolved by the identity-sourcing rule,
not restated here:

## Sourcing your recorded identity

When you record your own identity in a `model="..."` attribute, build
the value from two independently sourced parts: the model segment and
the optional effort suffix. Do not infer either from the skill-pack
name, the persona name, or an inherited environment variable.

- **Model segment — from the host's in-context identifier, verbatim.**
  Use the resolved long-form model identifier your host states
  in-context (for example, a host line such as
  `The exact model ID is claude-opus-4-8[1m]`). Transcribe it exactly,
  preserving version punctuation as the host writes it — keep the
  hyphen form (`claude-opus-4-8`), never normalise it to a dotted form
  (`claude-opus-4.8`), and never substitute a configured alias. Where a
  host states no resolved identifier in-context, fall back to the
  `model:` value in your own agent definition file.

- **Effort suffix — from your own definition file.** When your host
  exposes a reasoning-effort knob, read the effort from your own
  sub-agent definition file (`effort:` on Claude Code,
  `model_reasoning_effort` on Codex) and append it as a slash-suffix
  (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8[1m]/low`). Never derive the effort from
  `CLAUDE_EFFORT` or any other inherited environment variable: a
  sub-agent pinned to a low effort that is dispatched from a
  higher-effort parent session still records its own definition-file
  effort. A host with no effort knob omits the suffix entirely.

- **Override limitation.** The `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` runtime
  override is deliberately not read. A run that sets it still records
  the effort declared in the agent definition file, not the override
  value.


Apply that rule to fill the `<model>` segment of the trailer line. When
the host states no resolved identifier in-context, use the documented
fallback string
`Co-Authored-By: Speccy Skill Pack <noreply@anthropic.com>`.


The skill body does not check the current git branch; it trusts the
caller / host to have placed the working tree on a feature branch.
Commits land on whatever HEAD is.


Reviewers append their own `<review>` block via `speccy journal
append` and return a thin verdict; they never edit TASKS.md or the
journal file with file-editing tools. This running session does not
transcribe `<review>` blocks. It drives the review-induced writes
exclusively through the CLI verbs the partial above details:
`speccy journal show` to verify the round's reviews are complete and
to read back blockers, `speccy task transition` for the `in-review`
→ `completed` / `pending` state flip, and `speccy journal append
--block blockers` for the consolidated orchestrator-authored
`<blockers>` block. No `<review>` or `<blockers>` block is ever
appended to the `<task>` body in TASKS.md — TSK-006 rejects journal
elements there.

### Exit

Do not pick up another `in-review` task. If the caller wants
another task reviewed, the caller invokes this skill again.

After exit, the next reasonable step depends on TASKS.md state:
if any task is `state="pending"` (a retry), suggest
`speccy-work SPEC-NNNN`. If any remain
`state="in-review"`, suggest
`speccy-review SPEC-NNNN` again. If all tasks are
`state="completed"`, suggest `speccy-vet SPEC-NNNN`.
