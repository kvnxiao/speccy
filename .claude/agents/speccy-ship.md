# /speccy-ship

Writes `REPORT.md`, runs `speccy verify` as a CI dry-run, and opens
the pull request.

## When to use

After `/speccy-review` has flipped every task to
`state="completed"` and `/speccy-vet` has passed.
Confirm the spec state first:

```bash
speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json
```

Readiness semantics:

- `next_action.kind == "ship"` (exit 0) is the ship-readiness
  signal — all tasks completed, vet gate passing, no REPORT.md
  yet. Proceed.
- `next_action: null` paired with **non-zero exit** is the
  terminal-already-shipped signal — REPORT.md is present, the
  SPEC has already shipped. Stop; do not re-ship. Run
  `speccy archive SPEC-NNNN` if it should be moved out of the
  active tree.
- Any other `next_action.kind` (`work`, `review`, `vet`,
  `decompose`) means tasks remain — pick up
  `/speccy-work`, `/speccy-review`,
  or `/speccy-vet` first.

## Steps

1. The `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json` already run in "When to use"
   confirms ship-readiness (`next_action.kind == "ship"`, exit 0) and
   carries the `spec_md_path` and `tasks_md_path` fields that locate
   the files — no separate `speccy status` call is needed. If instead
   it returned `next_action: null` with a non-zero exit, REPORT.md
   already exists and the SPEC has already shipped; do not proceed.

2. Write `.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/REPORT.md` with frontmatter
   (`spec`, `outcome`, `generated_at`), a `<report>` root element
   wrapping one `<coverage req="REQ-NNN"
   result="satisfied|partial|deferred" scenarios="CHK-NNN...">`
   element per surviving SPEC requirement, retry counts, and any
   out-of-scope items implementers absorbed.

   Canonical REPORT.md shape: `.claude/skills/speccy-ship/references/report.md`.

3. Ship-time memory retro. With REPORT.md written and before the ship
   commit (step 6), distill the just-completed loop into mutations of
   the repo's loop ledger at `.speccy/MEMORY.md`. Mine the evidence
   already on disk — REPORT.md coverage, the per-task journal
   (`<blockers>` directives, review verdict flips, retry rounds), and
   the spec diff — rather than re-deriving the work from scratch.

   Resolve the diff baseline rather than hardcoding `main`, so a repo
   whose default branch is `master` or `trunk` still works:

   ```bash
   git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'
   ```

   Use the output as `<base-ref>`; if empty (no remote, detached
   HEAD), fall back to `main`. Read the spec diff with the single-arg
   `git diff <base-ref>`, **not** `git diff <base-ref>...HEAD`: the
   retro runs at step 3, before the step-6 ship commit, while the
   loop's per-task work is still uncommitted in the working tree (the
   work phase never commits per task). The single-arg form diffs the
   working tree against the ref and so captures that uncommitted work;
   the `<base-ref>...HEAD` form compares the merge-base against
   committed HEAD and silently misses it, handing the retro a stale or
   empty diff exactly when it must mine the just-completed loop. The
   entry shape you write here is defined once at:

   ## Memory ledger entry shape

The repo's loop memory lives at `.speccy/MEMORY.md` — a user-owned,
git-tracked file. `speccy init` never
enumerates or overwrites it, so a `--force` reeject leaves it byte-identical
and learned content survives speccy CLI updates. Its **absence is normal and
silent**: a missing or malformed ledger produces no `speccy verify` error or
warning, and the implementer simply has no slice to load.

### What earns an entry

Record an entry only when the lesson is **durable across specs and not already
enforced** by an existing gate, reviewer persona, or `AGENTS.md`/rule. Recording
nothing is the default outcome: a lesson a future implementer would re-derive
anyway, or one a gate already catches, earns no line. The bar is high on purpose
— the ledger stays small by refusing low-signal intake, not by capping or
evicting.

### The one-line entry shape

Every entry is a **single line** carrying three parts and no narrative:

- **Trigger** — the situation a future implementer matches against to decide
  the entry is relevant to the slice in front of them: a task area, a file
  region, or a recurring situation.
- **Corrective rule** — the action to take next time, stated so the implementer
  can act on it without re-deriving the context.
- **Provenance tag** — a compact bracketed `[SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN]` tag naming the
  SPEC and task that produced the entry, so it is auditable back to its source.

There is no mistake or history field: how the lesson was learned is not forward
signal, only the corrective rule is.

### Authoring discipline

- **Prefer abstract, convention-level wording over fragile code coordinates.**
  An entry phrased as a durable convention survives a refactor that moves or
  renames the construct it came from; an entry pinned to a specific function,
  line, or module name becomes a phantom reference the moment that construct
  changes. Write the rule, not the address.

- **The provenance tag is bracketed and resolves to a real SPEC and task**,
  never a fabricated one. Use the `[SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN]` form; drop the task
  segment to `[SPEC-NNNN]` only for a spec-wide lesson that no single task
  owns. Dangling SPEC/task provenance is the only structurally checkable slice
  of ledger hygiene; the rest is a semantic judgment the ship-time retro owns,
  deliberately not a CLI freshness check. Keeping provenance honest at authoring
  time is what makes that future check possible.

### Worked example

The placeholders below are illustrative — substitute your own values.

```markdown
- Implementing a new CLI subcommand that parses a bounded numeric flag → reach for the existing range-value-parser helper before writing a fresh bounds check; keep validation at the parse boundary. [SPEC-0042/T-001]
```


   The retro does these things in one pass:

   - **Capture.** Append a one-line entry to `.speccy/MEMORY.md` only
     when the lesson is **durable across specs and not already enforced**
     by an existing gate, reviewer persona, or `AGENTS.md`/rule — when a
     gate already catches the lesson, the gate is the memory and you
     record nothing. **Recording nothing is the default outcome**, even
     for a loop that hit friction (a blocking-then-passed review round, a
     retry round, a `<blockers>` directive) whose only lesson an existing
     persona or rule already enforces. There is no mandate to write at
     least one entry per friction loop and no "no durable lesson this
     loop" sentinel — a loop that earns no entry simply leaves the ledger
     untouched. When a loop does surface a genuinely new, durable,
     not-yet-enforced lesson, append exactly that lesson, **one entry per
     write** so the prose-layer append stays serial. Create the file if
     it does not yet exist.

   - **Compact (autonomous).** Before appending, run the bounding work
     that can only shrink the ledger — it needs no human approval and
     runs unattended in an `orchestrate → ship` run, because every
     outcome either refuses a write or shrinks the file. Drop a candidate
     already covered by an existing ledger line or by a durable doc
     (`AGENTS.md`, rule files, anything they point at) rather than
     appending it, and merge a new lesson into a near-duplicate existing
     line rather than adding a second. Compaction never deletes a
     non-redundant entry. Boundedness rests on this pass, not on
     promotion firing.

   - **Promote (human-gated).** Promotion of a stable,
     repeatedly-affirmed entry up into the durable tier (`AGENTS.md` /
     rules) is the **single memory mutation that requires human
     approval** — surface each promotion for approval and never promote
     silently or automatically, including in an autonomous run. On
     approval, make the durable-tier edit and **remove the promoted entry
     from `.speccy/MEMORY.md`** so it is not stored in both tiers. The
     ledger stays bounded by the autonomous compaction above even when
     promotion never runs.

   - **Phantom-reference GC.** Re-validate existing ledger entries
     against the current tree and retire or rewrite any whose
     referenced construct no longer resolves, so the ledger never
     feeds a phantom forward to the next implementer. Abstractly-worded
     convention entries that name no specific construct survive a
     refactor unchanged; entries pinned to a now-gone module or symbol
     are retired or reworded to the surviving convention. This is a
     semantic judgment plus the abstract-authoring discipline the entry
     reference describes — deliberately not a CLI freshness check, and
     no such mechanism is added.

   The resulting `.speccy/MEMORY.md` mutation lands in the same ship
   commit as REPORT.md (step 6), so the lesson and the loop that taught
   it ship together.

   **Mirror the future-spec subset of the deferred section.** Walk the
   REPORT "Deferred / known limitations" entries written at step 2 (the
   `<coverage result="deferred">` rows and any out-of-scope items) and
   ask, per item, "its own future SPEC, or just a limitation of this
   one?". Mirror ONLY the future-spec-worthy subset into
   `.speccy/BACKLOG.md` with provenance `SPEC-NNNN, ship`, per the
   reference below. Items judged local limitations — bug-level caveats,
   small follow-ups — stay in REPORT.md only and are not appended, so
   the backlog stays a high-signal new-spec register. This append lands
   in the same ship commit (step 6).

## Backlog ledger entry shape

The repo's future-spec register lives at `.speccy/BACKLOG.md` — a user-owned,
git-tracked file, sibling to `MEMORY.md` and distinct from it. `speccy init`,
`speccy init --force`, and reeject never create, enumerate, or overwrite it, so
learned content survives speccy CLI updates. Its **absence is normal and
silent**: a missing or malformed file produces no `speccy verify` error or
warning, and the CLI never reads it. The backlog is a flat, unordered list of
candidate specs — ideas worth their own SPEC later, not deferrals within a spec
already in flight.

### When to append a candidate

A producing phase appends an entry here only when it deliberately cuts a piece
of scope worth its OWN later spec — "not this spec, but its own SPEC later."
Self-create the file with the header below (copied verbatim) on first append,
then record the cut in the four-field shape below.

Distinguish the two kinds of cut. A future-spec candidate goes here. A cut that
is merely out of the current spec's scope is a spec-local Non-goal — it belongs
in that SPEC's `## Non-goals`, not the backlog.

### The file header

When the file self-creates on first append, the producing skill copies in this
preamble verbatim so the lifecycle stays legible to the next reader:

```markdown
# Speccy backlog — future-spec candidates

> User-owned, git-tracked, never created or overwritten by `speccy init`,
> `speccy init --force`, or reeject. Absence is normal and silent; the CLI
> never reads this file. Distinct from `MEMORY.md` (durable loop conventions)
> and from spec-local deferred surfaces (`## Non-goals`, deferred decisions,
> deferred coverage): each entry below should become its OWN spec. Promotion
> retires an entry by deletion. See
> `resources/modules/references/backlog-ledger.md` for the entry shape.
```

### The four-field entry shape

Every entry carries the same four fields, one line per field:

- **Title** — the prospective spec named in a phrase.
- **What & why** — what the spec would deliver plus the value it carries: the
  case for building it.
- **Deferred-because** — why it is not being built now: out of the current
  slice, needs infrastructure that does not exist yet, or blocked on some
  named prerequisite.
- **Provenance** — the originating spec and phase that surfaced the candidate,
  e.g. `SPEC-NNNN, ship` or `SPEC-NNNN, plan`, or `manual` for a hand-added
  entry.

### Authoring discipline

- **Terse.** One phrase per field. The backlog is a working list scanned at
  plan time, not a design document; a candidate that needs a paragraph to
  justify wants its own brainstorm, not a longer backlog line.

- **Provenance must resolve to a real spec and phase**, never a fabricated one
  — or `manual` when added by hand. Honest provenance is what lets a reader
  trace a candidate back to the moment it surfaced.

- **Promotion strikes the entry by deletion.** When a candidate becomes its own
  SPEC, delete its line; the promotion trail lives in git history and the new
  SPEC's own provenance. The backlog reads as current candidates only, never a
  tombstone field.

- **Many entries from one spec's loop is a focus smell.** The per-spec add rate
  is itself feedback: a single spec spawning a long tail of backlog entries
  signals the slice was drawn too wide or the work kept discovering adjacent
  scope. This is a signal to weigh, not an enforced threshold — nothing gates
  on it.

### Worked example

The placeholders below are illustrative — substitute your own values.

```markdown
- Title: Cross-repo spec linking.
- What & why: let a SPEC in one repo reference requirements in another so a
  shared contract has one source of truth; removes the copy-paste drift between
  the two repos that share the protocol.
- Deferred-because: needs a cross-repo resolution surface that does not exist
  yet — out of the current single-repo slice.
- Provenance: SPEC-0042, ship.
```


4. Flip the SPEC's frontmatter status. Edit
   `.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/SPEC.md` and change `status: in-progress`
   to `status: implemented`. The diff that ships in this PR is what
   makes the SPEC implemented, so the status flip belongs in the
   same PR, not in a follow-up. The status flip is hash-neutral
   because `status` is excluded from `spec_hash_at_generation`, so
   TASKS.md does not need a hash refresh and the spec-hash-mismatch
   lint cannot fire — no post-flip re-check is needed.
5. Run the CI gate locally as a dry-run *after* the status flip so
   verify reads the post-ship tree:

   ```bash
   speccy verify
   ```

   → expected: exit 0. A non-zero exit means the proof shape is broken
   (uncovered requirement, malformed task state, parser-rejected journal
   element) — stop and fix before opening the PR.

6. Commit SPEC.md, TASKS.md, REPORT.md, the `.speccy/MEMORY.md`
   mutation and any `.speccy/BACKLOG.md` mutation from the retro
   (step 3), and the code changes from the loop. Then push:

   - If this branch has no open PR yet, open one. Render the PR body
     from the canonical template at
     `.claude/skills/speccy-ship/references/pr-body.md`: fill its
     three placeholders (named `spec-dir`, `summary`, `coverage-rows`
     inside angle-bracket markers in the template) from
     `.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/SPEC.md`'s `## Summary` prose, the
     `<coverage>` elements in `.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/REPORT.md`, and
     the spec-dir path itself. Write the rendered markdown to a scratch
     file (e.g. `/tmp/pr-body.md`) and pass it via `--body-file`:

     ```bash
     gh pr create --title "<spec id> <slug>" \
       --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
     ```

     Do **not** pipe `REPORT.md` inline via shell command substitution
     into the `--body` flag. GitHub does not render the `<report>` and
     `<coverage>` XML wrappers as markdown, so the angle brackets leak
     into the PR page as visible prose; always use `--body-file` with
     the rendered template instead.

     Multi-SPEC fallback: branches that bundle multiple SPECs, or
     carry unrelated precursor commits, fall back to a hand-authored
     PR body. The template can serve as a per-SPEC starting skeleton
     when hand-authoring — render once per SPEC and stitch the
     sections — but this recipe does not prescribe multi-SPEC
     composition.

   - If a PR already exists for this branch (e.g., a long-running
     branch carrying multiple specs), push to update it:

     ```bash
     git push
     ```

   The status flip in step 4 lands in the same PR — no follow-up
   commit needed after merge.

## Exit

REPORT.md is written, the SPEC's frontmatter status is flipped to
`implemented`, the loop's uncommitted work is bundled into one atomic ship
commit, and a PR is opened (or the existing branch PR updated by push).
`speccy verify` passed as the CI dry-run. Single pass, no loop — the SPEC has
shipped; run `speccy archive SPEC-NNNN` if it should leave the active tree.
