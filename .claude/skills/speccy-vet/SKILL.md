# /speccy-vet

Final defense mechanism against SPEC drift at the pre-ship boundary.

The per-task implementer/reviewer cycle keeps each task honest
against its own scenarios. It does not catch drift that only appears
at the whole-SPEC level: requirements satisfied by no task, behavior
the diff introduces that the SPEC never authorized, or per-task
code that doesn't add up to the SPEC as a unit. This skill is the
final check before the PR opens.

This skill is **autonomous up to the ship point**. It fans out
review and implementer sub-agents, loops on drift, applies a
simplifier polish pass, and returns a single short verdict to its
caller. The caller (typically `/speccy-orchestrate`
at the `ship` boundary, but a human can invoke this directly) is
the one that gates the actual PR opening.

## When to use

- Every task in `SPEC-NNNN` is at `state="completed"` and the next
  step is to confirm the diff matches the SPEC as a unit before
  invoking `/speccy-ship`.
- A SPEC was amended mid-implementation and the human wants a final
  defense pass against drift before opening the PR.
- The `/speccy-orchestrate` outer loop reaches the
  `ship` boundary and delegates here.

Do not invoke this skill for per-task review (use
`/speccy-review`) or while tasks remain at
`pending` / `in-progress` / `in-review` (the skill returns `fail`
immediately if any task is non-completed — this is a pre-ship gate,
not a mid-loop check).

## Argument

```
/speccy-vet SPEC-NNNN
```

The `SPEC-NNNN` argument is required. The SPEC's tasks must all be
at `state="completed"` — this is a pre-ship gate, not a mid-loop
check. If any task is not completed, return a `fail` verdict
immediately with that as the reason.

## Why this skill runs in a top-level session

The drift-fix loop fans out additional sub-agents over multiple
rounds (`vet-reviewer`, `vet-implementer`, `vet-simplifier`).
Sub-agents cannot spawn sub-agents, so this skill must run in a
context that **is** the top-level session — either:

- A human invocation (`/speccy-vet SPEC-NNNN`), where
  the host CLI session itself runs the skill body, or
- The `/speccy-orchestrate` outer loop, which
  inlines this skill body into its own session at the `ship`
  dispatch (it cannot delegate to a wrapper sub-agent that would
  then try to spawn the leaves).

In both cases the leaf sub-agents (reviewer / implementer /
simplifier) return one short verdict block as their final message;
only those final messages flow back into the running session.

## What this skill writes and commits

This skill writes to VET.md and lets implementer / simplifier
sub-agents modify the working tree. It **does not commit
anything**. Per Speccy's atomic-landing convention,
`/speccy-ship` is the committer — it bundles all
uncommitted changes from the loop (per-task journal updates,
holistic changes, SPEC.md status flip, REPORT.md) into one commit
at PR time. VET.md, being under
`.speccy/specs/<spec-dir>/journal/`, ships alongside the per-task
journal files.

If a human invokes this skill directly (outside the orchestrator),
they will see uncommitted changes in `git status` after exit and
can decide whether to commit, revert, or continue editing.

## Holistic journal

This skill maintains a single per-SPEC journal file at
`<spec-dir>/journal/VET.md` (`<spec-dir>` is resolved in
Phase 0 below). The journal is the **persistent state** of the
holistic loop:

1. **Round-to-round communication** — round N's reviewer reads it
   to walk round N-1's findings and verify the implementer's claims
   against the current diff. Without it, every round re-derives
   from scratch and wastes the round budget.
2. **Audit trail** — after the skill exits, the human (or
   `/speccy-ship`) can read it to see what the loop
   caught and how.

### Single-writer rule

The **CLI's per-file append lock owns write serialization** for
VET.md. Every block reaches the file through `speccy journal append`:
the vet sub-agents (reviewer / implementer / simplifier) append their
own `<drift-review>` / `<holistic-fix>` / `<simplifier-scan>` /
`<simplifier-apply>` blocks, and this skill's session appends the
terminal `<gate>` block. No actor edits VET.md with file-editing
tools, and no actor hand-bootstraps the file — the lock serializes
the parallel appends so there is no race, and the CLI stamps `date`,
derives `round`, computes the gate's `tasks_hash`, and manages
invocation sectioning. This skill's session is the sole author of the
`<gate>` block and (when invoked under the orchestrator) of git
commits, but it does not transcribe sub-agent blocks.

### File format

The CLI creates VET.md with YAML frontmatter (`spec`,
`generated_at`) on the first ever append and opens each
`## Invocation N — <date>` section automatically when the file is
absent or its last section is gate-terminated — the skill never
writes the frontmatter or the invocation heading by hand. The
resulting shape is:

```markdown
---
spec: SPEC-NNNN
generated_at: 2026-05-21T22:00:00Z
---

## Invocation 1 — 2026-05-21T22:00:00Z

<drift-review verdict="blocking" round="1" date="..." model="...">
...
</drift-review>

<holistic-fix verdict="addressed" round="1" date="..." model="...">
...
</holistic-fix>

<drift-review verdict="pass" round="2" date="..." model="...">
...
</drift-review>

<gate verdict="passed" tasks_hash="..." date="...">
...
</gate>

## Invocation 2 — 2026-05-22T...

<drift-review verdict="..." round="1" ...>
...
</drift-review>
```

The `round` attribute is **per-invocation**; the CLI resets it to 1
at the start of each invocation section. `generated_at` in the
frontmatter is the file-creation timestamp and is never rewritten.

If a prior invocation crashed mid-loop, its section is left as-is —
the audit trail records what happened. The next append opens a fresh
section.

## Loop

This skill body is the canonical home of the vet-phases grammar: it
includes the `modules/skills/partials/vet-phases.md` partial below so
Phase 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 have a single source of truth. The
`/speccy-orchestrate` ship dispatch carries only a
pointer to this body, not its own copy of the partial, so the two
invocation paths stay in sync without duplicating the grammar.


Round budget: **3 rounds per invocation** for drift fixing. Each
round is expensive (full SPEC re-read + diff re-analysis +
implementer pass), so the budget of 3 is intentionally tighter
than the per-task implementer retry budget.

### Phase 0 — bootstrap

Resolve the two values that sub-agent prompts need. The CLI owns
VET.md's frontmatter and invocation sectioning, so this phase no
longer hand-bootstraps the file or hand-writes an `## Invocation N`
heading — the first `speccy journal append` for this invocation does
both for you (it creates the file with frontmatter on first ever
append, and opens `## Invocation N+1` automatically when the file is
absent or its last section is gate-terminated).

1. **Spec directory.** Run:

   ```bash
   speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json
   ```

   The `spec_md_path` field (e.g.,
   `.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/SPEC.md`) gives the absolute path to
   `SPEC.md`; strip the trailing `/SPEC.md` to get `<spec-dir>`
   (e.g., `.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/`). If the command exits
   non-zero, the SPEC has reached a terminal state — surface the
   stderr line and return `fail`. Only parse the JSON envelope
   when exit code is 0. If the spec is unknown, return `fail`
   immediately.

   Also verify every task in this spec is at `state="completed"`
   (read `<spec-dir>/TASKS.md`). If any task is `pending`,
   `in-progress`, or `in-review`, return `fail` — this is a
   pre-ship gate, not a mid-loop check.

2. **Diff baseline ref.** Run:

   ```bash
   git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'
   ```

   Use the output as `<base-ref>`. If empty (no remote, detached
   HEAD), fall back to `main`. Sub-agent prompts will pass this in
   for `git diff <base-ref>` — that command compares the **working
   tree** against the ref, including uncommitted changes, which is
   essential because the drift-implementer leaves changes
   uncommitted between rounds.

The invocation number `N` for this run is whatever the CLI assigns
on the first append — you do not pick it or write the heading. After
the first block of this invocation lands (the round-1
`<drift-review>` the vet-reviewer appends, or the Phase 3 `<gate>` on
a Phase 0 early-exit), read it back with `speccy journal show
SPEC-NNNN --json` to learn the invocation number for the return
contract's `invocation` field.

### Phase 1 — drift review and fix

Repeat for up to 3 rounds per invocation. The running session owns
the round counter and the working-tree snapshots; sub-agents own the
substantive review and fix work **and append their own blocks** to
VET.md via `speccy journal append` (the vet-reviewer appends
`<drift-review>`, the vet-implementer appends `<holistic-fix>`). The
CLI's per-file lock serializes those appends and stamps `date`,
`round`, and the invocation section — the running session never
transcribes a sub-agent's block and never edits VET.md with
file-editing tools.

**Protect the journal from rollback.** The sub-agents append to
VET.md *during their own runs*, so a block is already on disk before
the running session reaches its keep-vs-revert decision. Because
VET.md lives in the working tree, a naive `git restore .` /
`git stash pop` would revert those appends and erase the audit trail.
The journal is the durable record of *what the loop did* and must
survive any rollback. Two git facts drive the mechanism below:

- `git restore -- ':!…/journal/'` and `git clean -fd -e '…/journal/'`
  **do** honour the journal exclusion — a path-excluded restore and an
  `-e`-excluded clean both leave VET.md on disk. Use them directly.
- `git stash push --include-untracked` does **not** honour a pathspec
  exclusion for the *untracked* journal file: it sweeps VET.md into the
  stash regardless of any `':!…/journal/'` argument. A later
  `git stash pop` then tries to restore that stale copy over the live
  journal — at best it aborts with `already exists, no checkout`
  (leaving stash litter and a non-zero exit), at worst it clobbers the
  blocks appended since the snapshot. **Never `git stash pop` in this
  loop.**

So the loop snapshots with a plain `--include-untracked` stash (no
pathspec — the journal is swept in, then immediately restored by
`git stash apply`; because the journal is always dirty at vet time the
push always creates a stash, so `stash@{0}` reliably names *our*
snapshot and never a pre-existing unrelated one). On rollback it
restores prior-round **code** from the stash with a tracked-only
`git checkout 'stash@{0}' -- ':!…/journal/'`, which never touches the
stash's untracked journal copy, then drops the stash. The live on-disk
journal — with every block appended since the snapshot — is left
untouched throughout.

This is the **journal-safe revert sequence**. Every rollback in
Phases 1 and 2 runs these four commands verbatim — the restore and
clean undo sub-agent edits to tracked files and remove files it
added, the tracked-only checkout restores pre-sub-agent code from
the snapshot, and the drop discards it; all four exclude the journal
directory:

```bash
# Revert code to the pre-sub-agent snapshot; never touch the journal.
git restore -- ':!.speccy/specs/*/journal/'
git clean -fd -e '.speccy/specs/*/journal/'
git checkout 'stash@{0}' -- ':!.speccy/specs/*/journal/'
git stash drop
```

1. **Spawn the drift reviewer sub-agent.** Prompt:

   > Holistic drift review for `SPEC-NNNN`, invocation `N`, round
   > `R`.
   >
   > Resolved paths:
   > - Spec directory: `<spec-dir>` (use this for `SPEC.md`,
   >   `TASKS.md`, mission file if any, and the journal at
   >   `<spec-dir>/journal/VET.md`).
   > - Diff baseline: `<base-ref>` (run `git diff <base-ref>` —
   >   that captures the working tree including uncommitted
   >   changes, which the implementer leaves between rounds).
   >
   > Follow the focus, round-2+ scrutiny, and verdict-return
   > contract in your agent file. Append your `<drift-review>` block
   > to VET.md via `speccy journal append` and return a single thin
   > `<verdict>` element as your final message.

   Substitute `SPEC-NNNN`, `N`, `R`, `<spec-dir>`, and `<base-ref>`
   with the resolved values. The sub-agent appends its own
   `<drift-review>` block; do not transcribe it. Read the thin
   `<verdict>` it returns to decide the next step.

   Invoke the `Task` tool with `subagent_type: "vet-reviewer"`.
   The sub-agent definition at `.claude/agents/vet-reviewer.md`
   carries the host-native dispatch metadata (model pin, effort
   level).

2. **If `verdict="pass"`** → the vet-reviewer already appended its
   `<drift-review>` block. Exit the loop and go to Phase 2.

3. **If `verdict="blocking"` and no rounds remain** → the
   `<drift-review>` block is already in VET.md (the reviewer
   appended it), so the trail is complete. Return a `fail` verdict.

4. **Otherwise** (`verdict="blocking"` with budget remaining):

   a. **Snapshot the working tree** before the implementer call,
      so the running session can revert on `stuck`. The snapshot
      captures code state; the reviewer's just-appended
      `<drift-review>` block in VET.md survives because the revert
      scopes out the journal directory (see "Protect the journal
      from rollback" above):

      ```bash
      git stash push --include-untracked -m "speccy-holistic-pre-implementer-<spec>-inv<N>-r<R>"
      git stash apply
      ```

      The `push` snapshots all uncommitted state and clears it to
      HEAD; the `apply` restores the working tree so the implementer
      has the current implementation to work on. The stash stays
      available as the rollback target. The journal is swept into the
      stash by `--include-untracked` and immediately restored by
      `apply` (see "Protect the journal from rollback" above); the
      rollback path below restores code from the stash without ever
      touching that copy.

   b. **Spawn the drift-implementer sub-agent.** Prompt:

      > Holistic drift fix for `SPEC-NNNN`, invocation `N`, round
      > `R`.
      >
      > Resolved paths:
      > - Spec directory: `<spec-dir>`.
      > - Diff baseline: `<base-ref>` (use `git diff <base-ref>`
      >   to see the existing implementation; leave your changes
      >   uncommitted — the next reviewer reads the same command
      >   and will pick them up).
      >
      > The running session will revert your code changes if you
      > return `verdict="stuck"`. Do not manage rollback yourself.
      >
      > Follow the scope, hygiene-gate, and verdict-return
      > contract in your agent file. Append your `<holistic-fix>`
      > block to VET.md via `speccy journal append` and return a
      > single thin `<verdict>` element as your final message.
      >
      > The drift findings to address are in the most recent
      > `<drift-review>` block in VET.md; read them with
      > `speccy journal show SPEC-NNNN --block drift-review
      > --round latest`.

      The sub-agent appends its own `<holistic-fix>` block; do not
      transcribe it. Read the thin `<verdict>` it returns.

      Invoke the `Task` tool with `subagent_type: "vet-implementer"`.
      The sub-agent definition at
      `.claude/agents/vet-implementer.md` carries the host-native
      dispatch metadata.

   c. **Resolve the snapshot based on the implementer's verdict.**
      The `<drift-review>` and `<holistic-fix>` blocks are already
      in VET.md (each sub-agent appended its own), so this step only
      keeps or reverts the **code** changes — it never writes
      blocks:

      - **`addressed` or `blocking`**: keep the implementer's
        edits.

        ```bash
        git stash drop
        ```

        Decrement the round counter and go back to step 1. The next
        reviewer reads the journal the sub-agents appended and
        verifies the implementer's claims against the now-updated
        diff.

      - **`stuck`**: run the journal-safe revert sequence (see
        "Protect the journal from rollback" above). The
        `<drift-review>` and `<holistic-fix>` blocks in VET.md stay
        intact. Return a `fail` verdict.

      - **Sub-agent error or missing/malformed `<verdict>`**: treat
        as `stuck`. Revert the code as above. The vet-implementer
        appends its `<holistic-fix>` block (including the `stuck`
        case) as part of its own run; if it errored before
        appending, append a synthesized `<holistic-fix>` recording
        the sub-agent failure via `speccy journal append SPEC-NNNN
        --block holistic-fix --verdict stuck --model <orchestrator-model>`
        so the trail is complete. Return `fail`.

### Phase 2 — simplifier polish pass

Drift is now `pass`. Run one polish pass for code quality. This
phase does not affect the verdict (a revert still yields
`verdict="pass"`); it only sets the `simplifier="..."` field on
the return block.

1. **Spawn the simplifier scan sub-agent.** Prompt:

   > Identify simplification candidates in the diff for
   > `SPEC-NNNN`. Run `git diff <base-ref>` to see all changes
   > (working tree included). **Report only — do NOT modify
   > files.** Skip anything that would change behavior, weaken
   > invariants, or trip project conventions in `AGENTS.md` and
   > project-local rule files.
   >
   > Append your `<simplifier-scan>` block to VET.md via `speccy
   > journal append` and return a single thin `<verdict>` element as
   > your final message.

   Invoke the `Task` tool with
   `subagent_type: "vet-simplifier"`.

   The scan sub-agent appends its own `<simplifier-scan>` block; do
   not transcribe it. The scan makes no code modifications, so it is
   part of the audit trail whether or not an apply step follows. Read
   the thin `<verdict>` it returns.

2. If `verdict="clean"` → record `simplifier="clean"` for the
   return block and go to Phase 3.

3. If `verdict="candidates"`:

   a. **Snapshot the working tree** before the apply, so the
      running session owns the rollback. The simplifier
      sub-agent cannot reliably roll back itself — `git
      checkout` doesn't undo new files and `git clean -fd` is
      dangerous if scoped wrong. Owning the rollback here bounds
      the blast radius.

      ```bash
      git stash push --include-untracked -m "speccy-holistic-pre-simplifier-<spec>-<invocation>"
      git stash apply
      ```

      The first command snapshots uncommitted state and clears it to
      HEAD; the second restores the working tree so the simplifier
      sees the drift-fix changes. The stash remains as the rollback
      target. As in Phase 1, `--include-untracked` sweeps the journal
      into the stash and `apply` restores it; the rollback path below
      restores code from the stash without touching that copy (see
      "Protect the journal from rollback" above).

   b. **Spawn the simplifier apply sub-agent.** Prompt:

      > Apply the simplification candidates listed below.
      > Preserve all functionality. After applying, run the
      > standard hygiene suite per `AGENTS.md` (the project's
      > four standard hygiene gates).
      >
      > **If any hygiene step fails, do NOT attempt to revert
      > yourself.** Return `verdict="blocking"` with a one-line
      > description of what failed; the caller owns the rollback.
      >
      > The candidates to apply are in the most recent
      > `<simplifier-scan>` block in VET.md; read them with
      > `speccy journal show SPEC-NNNN --block simplifier-scan`.
      >
      > Append your `<simplifier-apply>` block to VET.md via `speccy
      > journal append` and return a single thin `<verdict>` element
      > as your final message.

      Invoke the `Task` tool with
      `subagent_type: "vet-simplifier"`.

      The apply sub-agent appends its own `<simplifier-apply>` block;
      do not transcribe it. Read the thin `<verdict>` it returns.

   c. Resolve the snapshot based on the verdict. The
      `<simplifier-apply>` block is already in VET.md (the sub-agent
      appended it), so this step only keeps or reverts **code**:

      - **`applied`** (hygiene green): `git stash drop` — discard
        the snapshot, keep the simplifications. Record
        `simplifier="applied"` for the return block.

      - **`blocking`** (hygiene failed), sub-agent error, or
        missing/malformed verdict: run the journal-safe revert
        sequence (see "Protect the journal from rollback" above). The
        `<simplifier-apply>` block in VET.md stays intact. If the
        sub-agent errored before appending, append a synthesized
        `<simplifier-apply>` recording the failure via `speccy
        journal append SPEC-NNNN --block simplifier-apply
        --verdict blocking` so the trail is complete. Record
        `simplifier="reverted"`.

### Phase 3 — append the `<gate>` block via the CLI

**Every** exit path — Phase 0 integrity failures, Phase 1
round-budget exhaustion, Phase 1 `stuck` reverts, Phase 2
completion (pass or revert), and the success path — appends
exactly one `<gate>` block to `<spec-dir>/journal/VET.md` via
`speccy journal append --block gate`, **before** surfacing the
verdict to the caller. This is the running session's own write (the
gate is not authored by a sub-agent), and it goes through the CLI
verb — never by editing VET.md with file-editing tools.

```bash
speccy journal append SPEC-NNNN --block gate --verdict <passed|failed> <<'EOF'
<one-line human-readable summary of the invocation outcome>
EOF
```

The CLI owns everything environment-derivable and the gate's
placement:

- It computes `tasks_hash` as the lowercase hex SHA-256 of the
  sibling TASKS.md read at append time — **do not compute or supply
  a hash**, and there is no `sha256sum` / `Get-FileHash` step.
- It stamps `date` (UTC now).
- It manages invocation sectioning: the gate lands as the **last**
  element of the current open invocation section, after any
  `<drift-review>`, `<holistic-fix>`, `<simplifier-scan>`, and
  `<simplifier-apply>` blocks the sub-agents appended. If no section
  is open yet (a Phase 0 early exit fired before any block landed,
  so VET.md is absent or its last section is gate-terminated), the
  same append creates the file with frontmatter and opens a fresh
  `## Invocation N` section before writing the gate. **Do not
  hand-bootstrap frontmatter or write an `## Invocation N`
  heading** — the append does both. The on-disk gate record exists
  regardless of where the early exit fired.

You supply only `--verdict` and the one-line body:

- `--verdict` — `passed` when the surfaced verdict will be
  `verdict="pass"`; `failed` when it will be `verdict="fail"`
  (including every Phase 0 early-exit path).
- body — a single line summarising what happened (examples: `"Drift
  cleared on round 2; simplifier applied; clean."`, `"Phase 0
  integrity check failed: task T-003 not completed."`, `"Drift round
  budget exhausted at round 3 without a pass."`).

Validation runs before any write; a malformed body or an attempt to
add a second gate to a gate-terminated section leaves VET.md
byte-identical.

`speccy next` reads the most recent `<gate>` block's `verdict`
and `tasks_hash` to decide whether the SPEC is freshly vetted; a
`passed` gate whose `tasks_hash` no longer matches the on-disk
TASKS.md forces a re-vet. That is the contract this block exists
to satisfy.


## Return contract

Return exactly one block as the final message of this skill's
session:

```
<orchestrator-verdict verdict="pass|fail" invocation="N" rounds="R" simplifier="clean|applied|reverted|skipped">
<one-line summary of the holistic outcome>
[if fail: one-line suggested next step (amend SPEC vs new task vs manual fix)]
</orchestrator-verdict>
```

Field reference:

- `verdict` — `pass` if drift cleared within budget; `fail`
  otherwise.
- `invocation` — the invocation number for this run, matching the
  VET.md section header.
- `rounds` — how many drift-fix rounds were consumed (0 to 3).
- `simplifier` — `clean` if no candidates were found; `applied` if
  candidates applied + hygiene green; `reverted` if applied but
  rolled back due to hygiene failure; `skipped` if Phase 2 didn't
  run (drift never cleared).

The caller consumes only this final block; the inner blocks live
in VET.md and the sub-agent contexts that produced them.

## Stop conditions

- Drift round budget exhausted (3 rounds in this invocation)
  without a `pass` from the drift reviewer → return `fail`.
- Drift-fix implementer returns `verdict="stuck"` → return `fail`
  immediately.
- Any sub-agent errors or returns a malformed verdict → return
  `fail` with the error in the one-line summary.
- Phase 0 finds the spec is unknown or has incomplete tasks →
  return `fail` immediately.

## When to invoke directly

A human can run `/speccy-vet SPEC-NNNN`
by hand:

- Before ever invoking `/speccy-ship`, as a
  final-defense check on a SPEC implemented manually.
- After amending a SPEC and re-running
  `/speccy-work` on the affected tasks, to confirm
  the patched implementation still adheres to the SPEC
  holistically. (Each direct invocation gets its own section in
  VET.md.)

The skill behaves identically whether invoked by the orchestrator
or by a human — only the caller of the verdict differs.

## Next step after exit

When the gate returns `verdict="pass"` and REPORT.md is absent for
the SPEC, suggest `/speccy-ship SPEC-NNNN` (rendered as
`/speccy-ship SPEC-NNNN` in the shared body) as the
next reasonable step — the SPEC is freshly vetted and ready to be
committed and PR'd. When the gate returns `verdict="fail"`, the
final block's one-line suggested next step takes precedence over
ship.
