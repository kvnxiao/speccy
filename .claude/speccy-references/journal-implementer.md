# Worked-instance reference: per-task journal `<implementer>` block

Canonical shape of an `<implementer>` block inside a per-task journal file,
continuing the `SPEC-0042` widget-render-timeout worked instance from `spec.md`
/ `tasks.md` in this directory. Illustrative example — substitute your own ids
and values.

A real journal file lives at
`.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/journal/T-NNN.md` (sibling of `SPEC.md` and
`TASKS.md`) and is parsed by `speccy verify` against the `JNL-*` lint
family.

## How the block is written

The implementer does not hand-author this block or its file. It runs
`speccy journal append SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN --block implementer --model
<your-model>` with the seven-field body piped on stdin. The CLI
creates the file with frontmatter on the first append, stamps the
`date` and `generated_at` timestamps, derives the `round`, and emits
the paired `<implementer>…</implementer>` element. The worked example
below shows what the CLI produces — the agent supplies only the body
text and `--model`.

## Full journal file shape

The first append on a task creates the file with YAML frontmatter
declaring exactly three fields (CLI-written), then the
`<implementer>` block beneath. This worked instance is `T-001`, which
covers `REQ-001` and `REQ-002`; it lands over two rounds (a round-1
off-by-one caught in review, then a round-2 fix — see "Subsequent
rounds" below).

```markdown

<implementer date="2026-05-21T19:45:00Z" model="claude-opus-4-8[1m]/low" round="1">
- Reuse survey: Mapped the task area (covered REQ-001 / REQ-002,
  suggested files `widget-cli/src/args.rs` and
  `widget-core/src/render.rs`, and their immediate neighbours).
  Decisions: reuse-as-is — the CLI's existing `clap::value_parser!`
  wiring for other numeric flags is the pattern the new `--timeout-ms`
  parser follows. Extend — added the `TimedOut` variant to the existing
  `widget_core::render::RenderError` enum rather than introducing a
  parallel error type. Write-fresh — the range bound on the value
  parser and the per-iteration elapsed-budget poll; searched
  `widget-core` for an existing deadline/budget helper and found none.
  No new top-level symbol beyond the `RenderError::TimedOut` variant and
  the `timeout_ms` field.
- Completed: Landed `--timeout-ms <N>` on `widget render` end-to-end.
  Added `timeout_ms: u32` to the `clap`-derived `RenderArgs` struct
  in `widget-cli/src/args.rs` with a range value parser rejecting
  values outside the 1–600000 bound and `default_value = "30000"`.
  Threaded the value into `widget-core::render::Renderer` as a
  `Duration` budget field; the render loop polls `Instant::elapsed`
  once per iteration and returns the new `RenderError::TimedOut
  { budget_ms }` variant on overshoot. CLI maps that variant to
  `std::process::exit(124)` after writing the deterministic stderr line
  `widget render: aborted after <budget_ms>ms (timeout reached)` (the
  configured budget, not measured elapsed, per DEC-002). Unit tests
  cover the range parser (rejects 0 / 600001, accepts 1 / 30000); a new
  integration test `widget-cli/tests/timeout.rs` drives the binary
  against `fixtures/cycle.gv` with `--timeout-ms 500` and asserts exit
  124, the stderr line, and wall-clock elapsed in `500..=600ms`.

- Undone: T-002 (help-text and README documentation) is left for a
  separate implementer turn per its `<task>` element in TASKS.md.
  Nothing from T-002's scope is deferred.

- Hygiene checks: the project's test gate exited 0 with 142 tests
  passing including the new `range_parser_rejects_zero`,
  `range_parser_rejects_600001`, and `cycle_fixture_times_out_at_500ms`
  cases. The remaining gates the project's `AGENTS.md` declares (here, a
  lint gate and a format check) each exited 0 with zero new warnings
  introduced.

- Evidence: red-then-green paper trail at
  `.speccy/specs/0042-widget-render-timeout/evidence/T-001.md`.
  Roll call for the four CHKs under REQ-001 / REQ-002:
  - CHK-001 (range-parser rejection): demonstrated → evidence
    Scenario 1 covers `--timeout-ms 0` exiting 2 with the
    SPEC-mandated stderr message.
  - CHK-002 (default 30000ms when flag omitted): hygiene → existing
    `render_timeout_observed` unit test in `widget-core` runs under
    the project's test gate and reads the effective value via the
    `--print-config` debug flag.
  - CHK-003 (cycle fixture aborts at budget): demonstrated →
    evidence Scenario 2 captures the pre-edit 60s hang versus the
    post-edit 511ms exit-124 run with the expected stderr line.
  - CHK-004 (trivial fixture under budget): demonstrated → evidence
    Scenario 3 confirms the happy path exits 0 with no
    timeout-attributable stderr.
  No CHK in T-001's scope is `judgment-only`; the timeout contract
  is fully scriptable.

- Discovered issues: The pre-existing
  `widget-core::render::cycle_detector::CycleDetector` carries an
  inline comment marking cycle handling as deferred work dating to
  before this SPEC. The comment is unchanged by this task (the
  timeout flag is the user-facing workaround until cycle detection
  lands as its own SPEC); flagged here so the next implementer
  touching the cycle detector sees the context.

- Procedural compliance: This implementer entry lands directly in
  `journal/T-001.md` per the journal-file schema. No
  `<implementer-note>` block was written into TASKS.md (the parser
  rejects that element). T-001's `state` flips from `in-progress`
  to `in-review` via `speccy task transition` as the final step
  of this turn. No shipped skill
  bodies under `skills/` required edits during this task — the
  implementer prompt at HEAD already documents the canonical
  seven-field handoff template, so no friction-to-skill-update was
  triggered.
</implementer>

## Attributes on `<implementer>`

All three are present on every block. Two are CLI-stamped; you supply
only `--model`.

- `date` — **CLI-stamped.** Full ISO8601 date-time with seconds and
  timezone designator (e.g. `2026-05-21T19:45:00Z`), set to UTC now
  at append time. Do not supply or compute it; there is no flag to
  override it.
- `model` — the model identity that ran the implementer turn, passed
  as `--model` to `journal append`. A slash-suffix encodes effort or
  reasoning-intensity when the host harness exposes that knob (e.g.
  `claude-opus-4-8[1m]/low`, `claude-opus-4-8[1m]/medium`). Hosts
  without an effort knob omit the suffix (e.g.
  `model="claude-opus-4-8"`). The CLI validates `--model` is
  non-empty but does not enforce suffix membership.
- `round` — **CLI-derived.** Monotonic positive integer starting at
  1; the CLI computes `max existing round + 1` (or `1` on a fresh
  file) so a round-1 turn writes `round="1"` and each post-blocker
  retry increments by exactly 1. Do not supply or compute it.

## Seven-field handoff template

The body of every `<implementer>` block uses these seven fields in
this order, each as a bullet line prefixed by `- <Field>:`.

- **Reuse survey**: the recorded pre-implementation survey — the
  task-area map and the per-tier decisions with named symbols
  (reuse-as-is / extend each name the existing symbol; write-fresh
  names the search that came up empty). A pre-implementation design
  input, so it leads the body. Round semantics: round-1 records the
  full survey; a retry round that adds no new top-level symbol and
  addresses a non-reuse blocker records `unchanged — no new symbols,
  no reuse blocker` (or just the delta), not a fresh re-survey.
- **Completed**: what landed in this turn, named concretely
  (files touched, behaviours observed). Past tense.
- **Undone**: what is deliberately deferred and why; what is left
  for the next turn or a follow-up task.
- **Hygiene checks**: the project's hygiene gates as defined in its
  `AGENTS.md` and their observed exit codes; any other commands the
  implementer ran for verification.
- **Evidence**: pointer to the per-task `evidence/T-NNN.md` paper
  trail, then an explicit roll call accounting for every
  `CHK-NNN` under the task's covered REQs. Each CHK is labelled
  with how it is proved:
  - `demonstrated`: a red-then-green `### Scenario` in the evidence
    file proves it; cite the scenario heading. `speccy journal append`
    refuses this block — naming the offending CHK id(s) and leaving the
    journal byte-identical — when a `demonstrated` claim has no backing
    scenario in `evidence/T-NNN.md`, so write the scenario before
    appending.
  - `hygiene`: a project test in the project's hygiene suite covers
    it; cite the test name or file path so a reviewer can re-run the
    same scope. A CHK proved by a passing suite test is `hygiene`, not
    `demonstrated`, and needs no scenario.
  - `judgment-only`: no scriptable demonstration is possible (e.g.,
    "error message is clear to a user", "naming reads well in
    context"); reviewer-business or reviewer-style judges it on
    the diff alone.
  A missing CHK in the roll call is blocking for reviewer-tests
  even if the project test suite is green -- the gap is exactly
  what the roll call exists to surface. The `judgment-only` label
  is an honest signal, not a failure mode: it marks where
  execution-based proof stops and persona judgment begins.
- **Discovered issues**: pre-existing problems noticed but not
  fixed (out-of-scope); context for the next implementer.
- **Procedural compliance**: confirms the state transition in
  TASKS.md and notes any shipped-skill edits made per the
  "friction-to-skill-update" convention in AGENTS.md.

## Subsequent rounds

On retry after a blocking review, run `journal append` again — the
CLI appends the new `<implementer>` block after the existing journal
contents (it does not modify earlier blocks), stamps the next
monotonic `round`, and leaves the original `generated_at` frontmatter
timestamp untouched. The agent supplies only the new body and
`--model`.

In this worked instance, round-1 review blocked on an off-by-one: the
value parser used an exclusive `.range(1..600000)`, which rejected the
inclusive maximum 600000 that REQ-001's done-when requires accepted
(see `journal-blockers.md`). The round-1 unit tests checked 0 / 600001
rejection and 1 / 30000 acceptance but never the 600000 boundary, so
the gap slipped past a green hygiene gate and into review. The round-2
block records the delta, not a fresh survey:

```markdown
<implementer date="2026-05-21T21:30:00Z" model="claude-opus-4-8[1m]/low" round="2">
- Reuse survey: unchanged — no new top-level symbol; the blocker is a
  range-bound off-by-one, not a reuse decision.
- Completed: Addressed the round-1 blocker. Changed the value parser's
  range from the exclusive `.range(1..600000)` to the inclusive
  `.range(1..=600000)` so the documented upper bound 600000 is accepted
  rather than rejected. Added the `range_parser_accepts_600000`
  regression unit test the round-1 suite omitted. No other behaviour
  changed; the exit-124 abort path and the DEC-002 budget-value stderr
  line are untouched.
- Undone: unchanged — T-002 docs still deferred to its own turn.
- Hygiene checks: the project's test gate exited 0 with 143 tests
  passing (the new `range_parser_accepts_600000` is the +1). The
  project's remaining hygiene gates each exited 0.
- Evidence: roll call unchanged from round 1 — CHK-001 / CHK-003 /
  CHK-004 demonstrated, CHK-002 hygiene. The off-by-one was an
  untested boundary (no CHK pinned 600000); `range_parser_accepts_600000`
  closes that gap under the hygiene suite.
- Discovered issues: none new this round.
- Procedural compliance: round-2 entry lands in `journal/T-001.md`;
  the CLI stamps `round="2"`. `state` flips `in-progress` → `in-review`
  for the second review fan-out.
</implementer>
```

Reviewers fanning out a second time write `round="2"` `<review>` blocks
(see `journal-review.md`); the same monotonic-no-skip rule applies.
