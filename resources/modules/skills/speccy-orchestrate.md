# {{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-orchestrate

Thin composition layer over the Speccy single-task primitives.
Queries `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json`, dispatches each step to one or more
sub-agents, and re-queries until the SPEC is ready to ship. This
skill owns the outer loop, per-task retry counter, review
consolidation, and vet dispatch. Leaf work happens in sub-agent
contexts that exit when done.

**Inline fan-outs.**
{% include "modules/skills/partials/inline-fanout-rationale.md" %}
`speccy-review` and `speccy-vet` therefore run inline in this
session and spawn their leaf sub-agents directly; `speccy-work` and
`speccy-ship` are delegated single sub-agents.

## When to use

- The user wants to drive `SPEC-NNNN` from its current state to
  ready-to-ship without chaining `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-work`,
  `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-review`, and
  `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-vet` by hand.
- The SPEC already has a `TASKS.md` — this orchestrator dispatches
  against existing tasks; it does not plan or decompose.

Stops one step before invoking `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-ship`
(ship pushes a branch and opens a PR — an outward-facing action —
and is always confirmed by the user). Do not invoke this skill for ad-hoc "implement one task" or
"review one task" asks; prefer the single-task primitives.

## Argument

```
{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-orchestrate SPEC-NNNN
```

The `SPEC-NNNN` argument is required. If missing, ask the user
which spec to drive and exit without looping.

## Dispatch Table

| `next_action.kind` | Dispatch | Stop / continuation |
|---|---|---|
| `work` | Spawn one `speccy-work` sub-agent for `task_id`. | Re-query after it returns. |
| `review` | Run the `speccy-review` fan-out inline. | Re-query after state flip and optional commit. |
| `vet` | Run the `speccy-vet` phases inline. | Re-query on pass; stop on fail. |
| `ship` | Ask the user, then spawn `speccy-ship` on confirm. | Stop either way after the answer. |
| `decompose` | Do not dispatch. | Tell the user to run `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-decompose`. |
| other / missing | Do not dispatch. | Report the observed `next_action`. |

All writes this orchestrator performs go through CLI verbs (`task
transition`, `journal append`, `journal show`); it never edits TASKS.md
state attributes or journal files with file-editing tools. Leaf
sub-agents return one short verdict block — their internal reasoning
stays in their context and in the journals.

Sub-agent final messages are **status hints, not state**. The
orchestrator always re-queries `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json` after a
dispatch settles to get ground truth.

**Exit-code-stop contract.** If `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json` exits
non-zero, the SPEC has reached a terminal state — halt the loop and
surface the stderr line to the caller. Only parse the JSON envelope
when exit code is 0.

## Startup integrity check

Before entering the dispatch loop, run one one-time sanity check
to catch state left by a crashed prior session.

{% include "modules/references/reconcile-summary.md" %}

1. Resolve the spec directory from `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json`:
   take the `spec_md_path` field and strip the trailing `/SPEC.md`
   to get `<spec-dir>`. If the command exits non-zero, surface the
   stderr line and stop — the SPEC is in a terminal state. If the
   command reports the spec is unknown, stop and report.

2. If that first query returned `next_action.kind == "reconcile"`
   (the CLI's consistency check flags drift from a prior crashed
   session), run the reconcile pass per the **Reconcile policy**
   above, then re-query; enter the dispatch loop only when
   `consistency.status == "ok"`. The pass is autonomous — no
   `AskUserQuestion`, no "press enter to continue" surface, anywhere
   in the dispatch path — and it owns every drift kind in the CLI's
   reconcile enum, including `state_in_progress_orphaned`
   (dirty tree) and `state_in_progress_clean` (clean tree), so the
   orchestrator never scans TASKS.md for `state="in-progress"`
   itself. Each subsequent loop iteration's
   `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json` (step 1 of the [Loop](#loop)
   section below) re-runs the same check: if a per-task operation
   leaves drift, the next iteration catches it and dispatches the
   reconcile pass before continuing to the normal `work` / `review`
   / `ship` dispatch.

## Loop

Repeat until a stop condition fires:

1. Query the CLI:

   ```bash
   speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json
   ```

   If the command exits non-zero, the SPEC has reached a terminal
   state (completed / dropped / superseded). Surface the stderr
   line to the caller and stop the loop. Only parse the JSON
   envelope when exit code is 0.

2. Dispatch on `next_action.kind`:

   - **`work`** — execute the [Work dispatch](#work-dispatch)
     section below.
   - **`review`** — execute the [Review dispatch](#review-dispatch)
     section below.
   - **`vet`** — execute the [Vet dispatch](#vet-dispatch) section
     below.
   - **`ship`** — execute the [Ship dispatch](#ship-dispatch)
     section below.
   - **`decompose`** — STOP. Tell the user to run
     `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-decompose` first; the orchestrator cannot
     loop on a spec without a task list.
   - **anything else** (unknown kind, missing field, `done`,
     `plan`, etc.) — STOP and report the observed `next_action`
     verbatim so the user can react.

3. After the dispatch settles (the one `speccy-work` sub-agent
   returns; or the reviewer-* personas have all returned, the
   orchestrator has verified completeness via `speccy journal show`
   and flipped state via `speccy task transition`; or the inline vet
   workflow has appended its `<gate>` block via `speccy journal
   append`), re-query `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json` and loop from
   step 1.

## Work dispatch

**Clean-tree precondition.** Before spawning the `speccy-work` sub-agent, the
orchestrator runs the gate in its own session: resolve the target task from
`next_action.task_id`, read `<spec-dir>/journal/T-NNN.md` (if present) and
classify its shape via the retry-shape rule below, then:

{% include "modules/references/entry-precondition.md" %}

For this orchestrator, "stop without dispatching" means halting the outer loop
and surfacing the dirty paths — no `speccy-work` sub-agent is spawned and the
loop does not advance. The retry case is the one named by the
`SPEC-NNNN → work T-NNN (retry 2/5 after blocking review)` status line below.

{% include "modules/references/retry-shape-summary.md" %}

Spawn a sub-agent that runs the `speccy-work` primitive for the
resolved task. Prompt:

> Implement task `SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN` per the `speccy-work` skill.
> Single-task primitive; do not iterate. Keep your final message
> short — the caller reads `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json` for ground truth.

Substitute the resolved `task_id` from `next_action.task_id`.

{% if host == "claude-code" %}Invoke the `Task` tool with `subagent_type: "speccy-work"`. The
sub-agent definition at `.claude/agents/speccy-work.md` carries
the host-native dispatch metadata.{% else %}Invoke Codex's native sub-agent-spawn primitive against the
registered `speccy-work` sub-agent at
`.codex/agents/speccy-work.toml`.{% endif %}

## Review dispatch

Run the `speccy-review` fan-out **inline in this orchestrator
session** (see "Inline fan-outs" above). The fan-out
grammar lives canonically in the `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-review`
skill body; this site carries only a pointer summary so the two
invocation paths stay in sync without duplicating the grammar.

**Review fan-out.** Spawn the five reviewer personas in parallel
(each appends its own `<review>` block via `speccy journal append`
and returns a thin `<verdict>`); verify the round is complete via
`speccy journal show`; flip state via `speccy task transition`
(`completed` on all-pass, `pending` on any blocking verdict); on a
blocking round append one consolidated `<blockers>` block via
`speccy journal append`; on a passing round perform the atomic
commit. See
`{{ skill_install_path }}/speccy-review/SKILL.md` § "Run the
persona fan-out and consolidation" for the full grammar (the spawn
prompt, the completeness / state-flip / consolidation steps, and
the commit recipe).

After the write settles, increment the per-task retry counter if
the task flipped back to `pending` (this is what feeds the
5-round stop condition below). Then re-query
`speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json`.

## Vet dispatch

Run the `speccy-vet` skill body **inline in this orchestrator
session** (see "Inline fan-outs" above). The vet-phases grammar
lives canonically in the `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-vet` skill body
(which includes the `modules/skills/partials/vet-phases.md`
partial); this site carries only a pointer summary so the two
invocation paths stay in sync without duplicating the grammar.

**Vet phases.** Phase 0 bootstraps the journal; Phase 1 runs drift
review with an autonomous fix-and-retry loop; Phase 2 runs the
simplifier polish pass; Phase 3 writes the final `<gate>` block. Run
in order; see {% if host == "claude-code" %}`.claude/skills/speccy-vet/SKILL.md`{% else %}`.agents/skills/speccy-vet/SKILL.md`{% endif %} § Phase N for the full grammar.

After the vet workflow appends its `<gate>` block and surfaces a
verdict to this orchestrator session, react as follows:

- `verdict="pass"` → write a one-line summary plus the round and
  simplifier counters, then re-query
  `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json`. The next iteration will observe
  `next_action.kind == "ship"` and route to the [Ship
  dispatch](#ship-dispatch) section below.
- `verdict="fail"` → surface the drift summary and one-line
  suggested next step. Stop the outer loop. The user decides how
  to address it (`{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-amend`, manual edits,
  etc.).

## Ship dispatch

The `ship` kind is emitted by the CLI after a fresh passing
vet-gate artifact lands and `REPORT.md` is absent, so the vet
workflow has already completed and the only remaining step is user
confirmation before opening a PR.

Ask the user via {% if host == "claude-code" %}`AskUserQuestion`{% else %}the Codex equivalent user-prompt primitive{% endif %} whether to invoke
`{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-ship` now. Ship pushes a branch and opens a
PR — an outward-facing action that notifies reviewers and triggers
CI — so this confirmation is always explicit; never auto-ship.

- On confirm: spawn a `speccy-ship` sub-agent.
  {% if host == "claude-code" %}Invoke the `Task` tool with `subagent_type: "speccy-ship"`. The
  sub-agent definition at `.claude/agents/speccy-ship.md` carries
  the host-native dispatch metadata.{% else %}Invoke Codex's native sub-agent-spawn primitive against the
  registered `speccy-ship` sub-agent at
  `.codex/agents/speccy-ship.toml`.{% endif %}
- On decline: stop the outer loop.

## Stop conditions

- `ship` dispatch declined by the user → stop the outer loop.
- Same `task_id` flips back to `pending` after review for
  **5 rounds in a row** → stop. The implementer is stuck on this
  task. Surface the journal path
  (`.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/journal/T-NNN.md`) so the user can
  read the blockers and decide whether to decompose
  (`{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-amend` + `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-decompose`),
  pick a different model, or intervene by hand. Track per-task
  retry counts in memory across loop iterations; the budget of 5
  is the orchestrator's only per-task retry bound.
- A dispatched sub-agent errors out → stop and surface the error.
- `next_action.kind` is not one of `work`, `review`, `vet`, `ship`,
  `decompose` → stop and report.
- User interrupts → stop on the next loop boundary.

## Status reporting

Before each dispatch, write one short status line so the user can
follow the loop without reading sub-agent transcripts:

```
SPEC-NNNN → work T-NNN
SPEC-NNNN → review T-NNN
SPEC-NNNN → work T-NNN (retry 2/5 after blocking review)
SPEC-NNNN → vet
SPEC-NNNN → ready to ship — confirm before proceeding?
```

Round numbers, per-persona verdicts, holistic drift findings, and
simplifier candidate details live inside sub-agent contexts and in
the per-task journals at
`.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/journal/T-NNN.md` (and, for the holistic
gate, in `.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/journal/VET.md`). Don't duplicate
them in the status line.

## Non-goals

- This skill does not run `speccy verify`, write `REPORT.md`, or
  open a PR. Those belong to `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-ship`, invoked
  after confirmation.
- The drift-fix loop and simplifier polish are **defined** in
  `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-vet` and re-described above only at the
  dispatch-shape level. The skill body of
  `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-vet` remains the source of truth for
  Phase 0–3 semantics — phase grammar bugs and `<gate>` block shape
  bugs get fixed there, not here.
- This skill does not pick a different persona fan-out for review,
  retry blocked tasks with a different model, or split tasks
  automatically. Those are judgment calls; surfacing the stuck
  state to the user is the right move.
