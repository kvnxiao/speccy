# {{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-orchestrate

Thin composition layer over the Speccy single-task primitives.
Queries `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json`, dispatches each step to one or more
sub-agents, and re-queries until the SPEC is ready to ship. This
skill itself holds the outer dispatch loop, the per-task retry
counter, and (for review and ship steps) the multi-persona /
multi-round fan-out — all leaf work happens in sub-agent contexts
that exit when done.

**Why fan-outs run inline in this skill's session.** Sub-agents
cannot spawn sub-agents. The persona fan-out in `speccy-review`
(five reviewer personas in parallel) and the drift-fix loop in
`speccy-vet` (reviewer + implementer + simplifier sub-agents across
up to three rounds) therefore cannot be delegated to a single
"wrapper" sub-agent that follows the skill body — the wrapper would
fail to spawn its leaf sub-agents. Instead, this orchestrator
follows the `speccy-review` and `speccy-vet` skill bodies **inline
in its own session** and spawns the leaf sub-agents directly. Only
`speccy-work` (which never fans out) is delegated to a single
sub-agent. Later sections reference this rule as "Why fan-outs run
inline"; it is stated once here.

## When to use

- The user wants to drive `SPEC-NNNN` from its current state to
  ready-to-ship without chaining `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-work`,
  `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-review`, and
  `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-vet` by hand.
- The SPEC already has a `TASKS.md` — this orchestrator dispatches
  against existing tasks; it does not plan or decompose.

Stops one step before invoking `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-ship`
(ship opens a PR — irreversible — and is always confirmed by the
user). Do not invoke this skill for ad-hoc "implement one task" or
"review one task" asks; prefer the single-task primitives.

## Argument

```
{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-orchestrate SPEC-NNNN
```

The `SPEC-NNNN` argument is required. If missing, ask the user
which spec to drive and exit without looping.

## Lifecycle (outer loop + inline fan-outs)

inner-3:  simplifier polish — described in speccy-vet, run inline
            here (no loop: one scan + one apply with hygiene gate)
```

The orchestrator owns the outer loop, the per-task retry counter,
the review consolidation step (verify completeness via `speccy
journal show`, flip state via `speccy task transition`, append the
consolidated `<blockers>` via `speccy journal append`), and the vet
round counter / snapshot management. Only the leaf work (one
implementer pass, one persona review, one drift review, one drift
fix, one simplifier scan / apply) lives in a spawned sub-agent. All
lifecycle writes the orchestrator performs go through the CLI verbs
(`task transition`, `journal append`, `journal show`); it never edits
TASKS.md `state` attributes or journal files with file-editing tools.

## Context discipline

`speccy-work` dispatches to **one** sub-agent because the
implementer pass is single-shot and does not need to spawn its own
sub-agents. Its final message comes back as a short status hint.

`speccy-review` and `speccy-vet` run inline in this session per
"Why fan-outs run inline" above; this orchestrator spawns their
leaf sub-agents (`reviewer-business`, `reviewer-tests`,
`reviewer-security`, `reviewer-style`, `reviewer-correctness`,
`vet-reviewer`, `vet-implementer`, `vet-simplifier`) directly. The
leaf sub-agents each return one short verdict block as their final
message; only those final messages — not the per-persona
reasoning — flow back into the orchestrator's context.

Sub-agent final messages are **status hints, not state**. The
orchestrator always re-queries `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json` after a
dispatch settles to get ground truth.

**Exit-code-stop contract.** If `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json` exits
non-zero, the SPEC has reached a terminal state — halt the loop and
surface the stderr line to the caller. Only parse the JSON envelope
when exit code is 0.

## Startup integrity check

Before entering the dispatch loop, run one one-time sanity check
to catch state left by a crashed prior session.

{% include "modules/references/reconcile-summary.md" %}

1. Resolve the spec directory from `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json`:
   take the `spec_md_path` field and strip the trailing `/SPEC.md`
   to get `<spec-dir>`. If the command exits non-zero, surface the
   stderr line and stop — the SPEC is in a terminal state. If the
   command reports the spec is unknown, stop and report.

2. If that first query returned `next_action.kind == "reconcile"`
   (REQ-007, REQ-008 — the CLI's consistency check flags drift from
   a prior crashed session), run the reconcile pass per the
   **Reconcile policy** above, then re-query; enter the dispatch
   loop only when `consistency.status == "ok"`. The pass is
   autonomous — no `AskUserQuestion`, no "press enter to continue"
   surface, anywhere in the dispatch path — and it owns every drift
   kind in REQ-006's enum, including `state_in_progress_orphaned`
   (dirty tree) and `state_in_progress_clean` (clean tree), so the
   orchestrator never scans TASKS.md for `state="in-progress"`
   itself. Each subsequent loop iteration's
   `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json` (step 1 of the [Loop](#loop)
   section below) re-runs the same check: if a per-task operation
   leaves drift, the next iteration catches it and dispatches the
   reconcile pass before continuing to the normal `work` / `review`
   / `ship` dispatch.

## Loop

Repeat until a stop condition fires:

1. Query the CLI:

   ```bash
   speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json
   ```

   If the command exits non-zero, the SPEC has reached a terminal
   state (completed / dropped / superseded). Surface the stderr
   line to the caller and stop the loop. Only parse the JSON
   envelope when exit code is 0.

2. Dispatch on `next_action.kind`:

   - **`work`** — execute the [Work dispatch](#work-dispatch)
     section below.
   - **`review`** — execute the [Review dispatch](#review-dispatch)
     section below.
   - **`vet`** — execute the [Vet dispatch](#vet-dispatch) section
     below.
   - **`ship`** — execute the [Ship dispatch](#ship-dispatch)
     section below.
   - **`decompose`** — STOP. Tell the user to run
     `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-decompose` first; the orchestrator cannot
     loop on a spec without a task list.
   - **anything else** (unknown kind, missing field, `done`,
     `plan`, etc.) — STOP and report the observed `next_action`
     verbatim so the user can react.

3. After the dispatch settles (the one `speccy-work` sub-agent
   returns; or the reviewer-* personas have all returned, the
   orchestrator has verified completeness via `speccy journal show`
   and flipped state via `speccy task transition`; or the inline vet
   workflow has appended its `<gate>` block via `speccy journal
   append`), re-query `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json` and loop from
   step 1.

## Work dispatch

**Clean-tree precondition (SPEC-0045 REQ-002, extended by SPEC-0047
REQ-002).** Before spawning the `speccy-work` sub-agent, run three
steps in the orchestrator's running session:

1. Resolve the target task from `next_action.task_id`.
2. Read `<spec-dir>/journal/T-NNN.md` (if it exists) and apply the
   retry-shape rule summarized immediately below (canonical
   statement at `{{ speccy_references_path }}/retry-shape.md`).
3. Run `git status --porcelain`. **First-attempt shape** with
   non-empty stdout halts the outer loop and surfaces the dirty
   paths to the user — no `speccy-work` sub-agent is spawned, and
   the loop does not advance (today's SPEC-0045/REQ-002 behaviour,
   unchanged). Empty stdout proceeds to the dispatch below.
   **Retry shape** proceeds to spawn the `speccy-work` sub-agent
   regardless of stdout — the dirty paths are the prior pass's WIP
   that the retry implementer amends in place; no dirty-paths
   surface is written. The retry case is the one named by the
   `SPEC-NNNN → work T-NNN (retry 2/5 after blocking review)`
   status line below.

This check fires in the orchestrator's session (not delegated to
the sub-agent) because the outer loop's invariant — every
dispatched implementer turn begins on a known tree shape — must be
enforced by the loop owner. The `speccy-work` skill body re-runs
the same retry-aware precondition defensively at its own entry as
a second-level guard.

**Retry shape.** A task is in retry shape iff its journal contains
both an `<implementer>` element and a `<blockers>` element whose
`round` attribute matches the highest implementer round. Otherwise
it's first-attempt shape — the strict clean-tree gate applies. See
`{{ speccy_references_path }}/retry-shape.md` for the full rule
statement, read-only scope, worked examples, and the
"implementer awaiting review" edge case.

Spawn a sub-agent that runs the `speccy-work` primitive for the
resolved task. Prompt:

> Implement task `SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN` per the `speccy-work` skill.
> Single-task primitive; do not iterate. Keep your final message
> short — the caller reads `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json` for ground truth.

Substitute the resolved `task_id` from `next_action.task_id`.

{% if host == "claude-code" %}Invoke the `Task` tool with `subagent_type: "speccy-work"`. The
sub-agent definition at `.claude/agents/speccy-work.md` carries
the host-native dispatch metadata.{% else %}Invoke Codex's native sub-agent-spawn primitive against the
registered `speccy-work` sub-agent at
`.codex/agents/speccy-work.toml`.{% endif %}

## Review dispatch

Run the `speccy-review` fan-out **inline in this orchestrator
session** (see "Why fan-outs run inline" above). The fan-out
grammar lives canonically in the `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-review`
skill body; this site carries only a pointer summary so the two
invocation paths stay in sync without duplicating the grammar.

**Review fan-out.** Spawn the five reviewer personas in parallel
(each appends its own `<review>` block via `speccy journal append`
and returns a thin `<verdict>`); verify the round is complete via
`speccy journal show`; flip state via `speccy task transition`
(`completed` on all-pass, `pending` on any blocking verdict); on a
blocking round append one consolidated `<blockers>` block via
`speccy journal append`; on a passing round perform the atomic
commit. See
`{{ skill_install_path }}/speccy-review/SKILL.md` § "Run the
persona fan-out and consolidation" for the full grammar (the spawn
prompt, the completeness / state-flip / consolidation steps, and
the commit recipe).

After the write settles, increment the per-task retry counter if
the task flipped back to `pending` (this is what feeds the
5-round stop condition below). Then re-query
`speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json`.

## Vet dispatch

Run the `speccy-vet` skill body **inline in this orchestrator
session** (see "Why fan-outs run inline" above). The vet-phases grammar
lives canonically in the `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-vet` skill body
(which includes the `modules/skills/partials/vet-phases.md`
partial); this site carries only a pointer summary so the two
invocation paths stay in sync without duplicating the grammar.

**Vet phases.** Phase 0 bootstraps the journal; Phase 1 runs drift
review with an autonomous fix-and-retry loop; Phase 2 runs the
simplifier polish pass; Phase 3 writes the final `<gate>` block. Run
in order; see {% if host == "claude-code" %}`.claude/skills/speccy-vet/SKILL.md`{% else %}`.agents/skills/speccy-vet/SKILL.md`{% endif %} § Phase N for the full grammar.

After the vet workflow appends its `<gate>` block and surfaces a
verdict to this orchestrator session, react as follows:

- `verdict="pass"` → write a one-line summary plus the round and
  simplifier counters, then re-query
  `speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json`. The next iteration will observe
  `next_action.kind == "ship"` and route to the [Ship
  dispatch](#ship-dispatch) section below.
- `verdict="fail"` → surface the drift summary and one-line
  suggested next step. Stop the outer loop. The user decides how
  to address it (`{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-amend`, manual edits,
  etc.).

## Ship dispatch

The `ship` kind is emitted by the CLI after a fresh passing
vet-gate artifact lands and `REPORT.md` is absent, so the vet
workflow has already completed and the only remaining step is user
confirmation before opening a PR.

Ask the user via {% if host == "claude-code" %}`AskUserQuestion`{% else %}the Codex equivalent user-prompt primitive{% endif %} whether to invoke
`{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-ship` now. Ship opens a PR — irreversible —
so this confirmation is always explicit; never auto-ship.

- On confirm: spawn a `speccy-ship` sub-agent.
  {% if host == "claude-code" %}Invoke the `Task` tool with `subagent_type: "speccy-ship"`. The
  sub-agent definition at `.claude/agents/speccy-ship.md` carries
  the host-native dispatch metadata.{% else %}Invoke Codex's native sub-agent-spawn primitive against the
  registered `speccy-ship` sub-agent at
  `.codex/agents/speccy-ship.toml`.{% endif %}
- On decline: stop the outer loop.

## Stop conditions

- `ship` dispatch declined by the user → stop the outer loop.
- Same `task_id` flips back to `pending` after review for
  **5 rounds in a row** → stop. The implementer is stuck on this
  task. Surface the journal path
  (`.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/journal/T-NNN.md`) so the user can
  read the blockers and decide whether to decompose
  (`{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-amend` + `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-decompose`),
  pick a different model, or intervene by hand. Track per-task
  retry counts in memory across loop iterations; the budget of 5
  is the orchestrator's only per-task retry bound.
- A dispatched sub-agent errors out → stop and surface the error.
- `next_action.kind` is not one of `work`, `review`, `vet`, `ship`,
  `decompose` → stop and report.
- User interrupts → stop on the next loop boundary.

## Status reporting

Before each dispatch, write one short status line so the user can
follow the loop without reading sub-agent transcripts:

```
SPEC-NNNN → work T-003
SPEC-NNNN → review T-003
SPEC-NNNN → work T-003 (retry 2/5 after blocking review)
SPEC-NNNN → vet
SPEC-NNNN → ready to ship — confirm before proceeding?
```

Round numbers, per-persona verdicts, holistic drift findings, and
simplifier candidate details live inside sub-agent contexts and in
the per-task journals at
`.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/journal/T-NNN.md` (and, for the holistic
gate, in `.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/journal/VET.md`). Don't duplicate
them in the status line.

## Non-goals

- This skill does not run `speccy verify`, write `REPORT.md`, or
  open a PR. Those belong to `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-ship`, invoked
  after confirmation.
- The drift-fix loop and simplifier polish are **defined** in
  `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-vet` and re-described above only at the
  dispatch-shape level. The skill body of
  `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-vet` remains the source of truth for
  Phase 0–3 semantics — phase grammar bugs and `<gate>` block shape
  bugs get fixed there, not here.
- This skill does not pick a different persona fan-out for review,
  retry blocked tasks with a different model, or split tasks
  automatically. Those are judgment calls; surfacing the stuck
  state to the user is the right move.
