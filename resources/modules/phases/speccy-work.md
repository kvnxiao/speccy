# {{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-work

Implements one task per invocation and exits. With an optional
`[SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN]` selector argument, the session implements that
specific task. Without an argument, the session resolves the next
implementable task via `speccy next --json` (workspace form — used here
because no SPEC is known on the no-selector path) and implements that one.
Task state lives in the `state` attribute on each `<task>` XML element
in TASKS.md.

This is a single-task primitive. It does not iterate over the task
list; composition across tasks belongs to a caller (a human at the
terminal, the `/loop` skill, or a future orchestrator).

## When to use

- With a selector (`{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-work SPEC-NNNN/T-003`):
  when the next task to implement is already known — e.g., a retry
  after `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-review` flipped a task back to
  `state="pending"`.
- Without an argument: when picking up wherever `TASKS.md` left
  off. The session implements one task and exits.

`{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-decompose` must have written `TASKS.md` and the
spec hash must have been committed before this skill runs.

The agent automatically detects retry shape from the per-task
journal at `<spec-dir>/journal/T-NNN.md` and switches modes
accordingly — the caller does not pass a flag. A first-attempt
task (no journal, or no `<blockers>` matching the highest
`<implementer>` round) runs today's recipe unchanged. A retry-shape
task (the latest `<blockers>` round equals the highest
`<implementer>` round) amends the existing WIP in the working tree
in place and appends a new `<implementer>` block (the CLI stamps the
incremented round).

## What to consider

- Re-read the task's `covers="REQ-NNN"` REQ's `<done-when>`
  (acceptance criteria) and `<behavior>` (test selection) elements
  before writing tests — not the surrounding prose alone.
- The suggested-files hint in the task body is advisory and may be
  stale; verify each path before editing.
- Are you about to add a feature flag, abstraction layer, or
  configurability the SPEC did not ask for? Stop and reconsider —
  scope creep is a blocker for the reviewer round.

## Steps

**Entry precondition (SPEC-0045 REQ-002, extended by SPEC-0047 REQ-002 / REQ-003):** before any Task dispatch, (i) resolve the target task per step 1, (ii) read `<spec-dir>/journal/T-NNN.md` (if it exists) and apply the retry-shape rule summarized at step 2 (canonical statement at `{{ speccy_references_path }}/retry-shape.md`), (iii) run `git status --porcelain`. **First-attempt shape** with non-empty stdout exits the skill (surface dirty paths on stderr); empty stdout proceeds with the first-attempt branch (today's SPEC-0045/REQ-002 behaviour). **Retry shape** proceeds with the retry branch regardless of stdout — the dirty paths are the prior pass's WIP that the retry implementer amends in place; no dirty-paths surface is written. If `speccy next --json` then returns `next_action.kind == "reconcile"`, dispatch the reconcile pass per the **Reconcile policy** summary below (canonical policy at `{{ speccy_references_path }}/reconcile-policy.md`) rather than the normal implementer flow.

**Reconcile policy.** When `speccy next --json` returns `next_action.kind == "reconcile"`, iterate `consistency.drifts[]` and apply the table action per entry, then re-query before proceeding. See `{{ speccy_references_path }}/reconcile-policy.md` for the full policy table.

1. Resolve the target task.

   - If a `SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN` selector was passed, that is the target.
   - Otherwise, query the CLI in workspace form (no SPEC selector
     is known on this no-selector invocation path — we must walk
     the active tree to find an implementable task):

     ```bash
     # workspace form: no SPEC-NNNN known yet; scan the active tree.
     speccy next --json
     ```

     Workspace-form exit-code-stop contract: exit code 2 with a
     top-level `reason="no_active_specs"` field in the JSON envelope
     means the workspace has no active specs at all (fresh repo, or
     every spec has shipped or been archived). Exit gracefully and
     surface the reason; do not treat the non-zero exit as a CLI
     error.

     On exit code 0, if the resulting `specs` array has no entry
     with `next_action.kind == "work"`, exit and report that no
     implementable tasks remain. Otherwise, construct the
     disambiguated `<spec>/<task>` form from the JSON's `spec_id`
     and `next_action.task_id` fields (the bare task ID is
     ambiguous across specs — every spec has its own `T-001`).

     Exit-code-stop contract: once SPEC-NNNN is resolved, any
     subsequent per-spec query (`speccy next SPEC-NNNN --json`) that
     exits non-zero means the SPEC has reached a terminal state —
     halt and surface the stderr line. Only parse JSON when exit
     code is 0.

2. Read `<spec-dir>/journal/T-NNN.md` (if it exists) and apply the
   REQ-001 retry-shape rule summarized immediately below. The rule
   reads only the journal file — no git, no `speccy next`, no
   other CLI subcommand. Compute the result (first-attempt shape
   or retry shape); the rest of the recipe branches on this
   result.

   **Retry shape.** A task is in retry shape iff its journal
   contains both an `<implementer>` element and a `<blockers>`
   element whose `round` attribute matches the highest implementer
   round. Otherwise it's first-attempt shape — the strict
   clean-tree gate applies. See
   `{{ speccy_references_path }}/retry-shape.md` for the full rule
   statement, read-only scope, worked examples, and the
   "implementer awaiting review" edge case.

3. Branch on the rule result.

   **First-attempt branch.** Proceed with the recipe below
   (steps 4–10) unchanged: flip state to `in-progress`, read
   scenarios, run the bounded reuse survey, implement from scratch,
   self-review, run the hygiene gate, flip to `in-review`, append the
   round-1 `<implementer>` block via `speccy journal append`.

   **Retry branch.** Enter retry mode:

   - Read the most recent `<implementer>` block in the journal to
     understand the prior pass's stated `Completed` work.
   - Read the latest `<blockers>` block (the one whose `round`
     matches the highest `<implementer>` round) for the specific
     feedback to address.
   - Amend the existing WIP in the working tree to address the
     blockers. Do not run `git restore`, `git clean`, or
     `git checkout` against the dirty paths; do not rewrite the
     touched files from scratch; do not reset state. The dirty
     tree is the prior pass's WIP — iterate on it in place.
   - Flip state to `in-progress` and continue through the same
     hygiene gate and `in-review` flip the first-attempt branch
     uses (the SPEC-0045/REQ-001 hygiene gate runs unchanged).
   - Append the next `<implementer>` block via `speccy journal
     append` (step 9); the CLI derives and stamps the incremented
     round. The retry-mode `Completed` field describes the amend
     (what changed this round in response to the blockers), not a
     restatement of the cumulative task work.

4. Flip the target task's `state` from `pending` to `in-progress`
   by editing TASKS.md.

5. Read the task scenarios to understand what must be implemented:

   ```bash
   speccy check SPEC-NNNN/T-003
   ```

6. Bounded reuse survey. Before writing any code, survey the
   task-relevant area and classify the code you are about to add into
   reuse-as-is / extend / write-fresh, so reuse is a design input
   rather than a post-hoc cleanup. Scope the survey to the task's
   area — its covered REQs, the suggested-files hint, and the
   immediate module / neighbouring files — and **not** the whole repo.
   Let the survey inform what you write in the next step.

   {% include "modules/references/reuse-survey-implementer.md" %}

7. Implement the task. Write tests first, then code. Run the
   project's own test command (`cargo test`, `pnpm test`, etc.)
   locally. Use `speccy check SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN` to re-read the
   scenarios being satisfied (it renders them, it does not run
   them).

8. Self-review before handoff. Immediately after implementation and
   **before** the exit transition's `in-review` flip, re-read your
   own diff through the reviewers' lens and fix what you find in
   place. This is the cheap place to catch drift: a fix here is a
   few edits in a diff you already have open, whereas the same drift
   caught at review is a full bounce-and-respawn round. Address the
   findings now; do not defer them to the reviewers.

   **Reviewer north-star map.** Each of the four review personas is
   chasing one outcome. Hold your diff to all four — this is what
   "good" looks like, not how the reviewers hunt for problems:

   - **Business.** The change does what the task's covered REQs
     actually ask for — no more, no less. Every changed line traces
     to a requirement; nothing in scope is left undone and nothing
     out of scope sneaks in.
   - **Tests.** Tests drive real behaviour and assert the specific
     contract under test, and the evidence is honest and complete —
     each covered CHK is accounted for, red/green pairs show what
     they claim, and nothing is glossed.
   - **Security.** Inputs are validated, errors are handled rather
     than swallowed, and the change introduces no unsafe shortcut
     (no panicking on attacker-influenced input, no secret or unsafe
     default left in).
   - **Style.** The diff reads as though the surrounding code's
     author wrote it and re-applies the project's own conventions.
     For the specifics, work the shared convention-drift checklist
     below.

   {% include "modules/references/convention-checklist.md" %}

9. Exit transition. **Hygiene gate (REQ-001):** before flipping `state` from `in-progress` to `in-review`, run the four standard hygiene gates in sequence — `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, `cargo +nightly fmt --all --check`, `cargo deny check`. Any non-zero exit refuses the flip and keeps the task at `in-progress`; on all zeros, proceed with the flip and record one line per gate naming its exit code in the appended `<implementer>` block's `Hygiene checks` field. When the implementation is done, flip the task's
   `state="..."` attribute from `in-progress` to `in-review` in
   TASKS.md, then append one `<implementer>` block to the per-task
   journal via `speccy journal append`. Do NOT inline an
   `<implementer-note>` inside the `<task>` body in TASKS.md — the
   parser rejects that element. The journal file is the canonical
   home for implementer handoff prose.

   Append via the CLI. Pipe the seven-field body on stdin:

   ```bash
   speccy journal append SPEC-NNNN/T-NNN --block implementer \
     --model <your-model> <<'EOF'
   - Reuse survey: ...
   - Completed: ...
   - Undone: ...
   - Hygiene checks: ...
   - Evidence: ...
   - Discovered issues: ...
   - Procedural compliance: ...
   EOF
   ```

   The CLI is the sole authority for the block's `date` and `round`
   and for creating the journal file with frontmatter on the first
   append — it stamps `date` (UTC now), derives `round`
   (`max existing round + 1`, or `1` on a fresh file), writes the
   three-field frontmatter when creating the file, and emits the
   paired `<implementer>…</implementer>` element with a correct
   closing tag. **Do not compute, supply, or mention `date`,
   `round`, `generated_at`, or hand-author the block's open/close
   tags** — there is no flag to override them, and the body you pipe
   is the inner text only. Validation runs before any write; a
   malformed body leaves the journal byte-identical (or still
   absent). On a retry round the same command appends after the
   existing journal contents and increments `round` for you.

   `--model` is required. Encode reasoning effort (when your host
   harness exposes an effort knob) as a slash-suffix on the model
   string (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8[1m]/low`); hosts without an effort
   knob omit the suffix. The CLI validates `--model` is non-empty.

   {% include "modules/references/identity-sourcing.md" %}

   Canonical journal `<implementer>` shape: `references/journal-implementer.md`.

   Canonical evidence file shape: `{{ speccy_references_path }}/evidence.md`.

   Body content. Use the seven-field handoff template the implementer
   prompt supplies (`Reuse survey`, `Completed`, `Undone`,
   `Hygiene checks`, `Evidence`, `Discovered issues`,
   `Procedural compliance`). The
   `Evidence` field must include a CHK-by-CHK roll call labelling
   each CHK under the task's covered REQs as `demonstrated`,
   `hygiene`, or `judgment-only` -- see the canonical reference for
   the format and what each label means.

   Minimal Evidence roll-call shape -- substitute real CHK ids,
   paths, and test names; the canonical reference carries the full
   worked example:

   ```
   - Evidence: paper trail at `.speccy/specs/NNNN-slug/evidence/T-NNN.md`.
     Roll call for CHKs under REQ-NNN:
     - CHK-NNN (one-line CHK description): demonstrated →
       evidence Scenario N covers <what the red/green pair shows>.
     - CHK-NNN (one-line CHK description): hygiene →
       `<test_name>` in `<file:path>` covers it under the project
       test command.
     - CHK-NNN (one-line CHK description): judgment-only →
       no scriptable proof; reviewer-business / reviewer-style
       judges on the diff.
   ```

   After the append, re-read the journal and confirm the new
   `<implementer>` block landed and `speccy next --json` reports no
   `journal_xml_malformed` consistency drift.

10. Exit. Do not continue to the next task. If the caller wants
   another task, the caller invokes this skill again.

After exit, the next reasonable step depends on TASKS.md state: if
any task is `state="in-review"`, suggest
`{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-review SPEC-NNNN`. If all tasks are
`state="completed"`, suggest `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-vet SPEC-NNNN`.
