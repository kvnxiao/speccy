# {{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-bootstrap

Seeds the Speccy conventions into the project's root `AGENTS.md` — the
`## Product north star` (freeze-on-first-write) and the always-upserted
`## Speccy conventions` section. The `.speccy/` workspace and the
`{% if host == "claude-code" %}.claude{% else %}.agents{% endif %}/skills/` skill pack
already exist by the time this skill runs: a prior `speccy init` is what
scaffolded them and ejected this skill pack. This skill does the
`AGENTS.md` seeding only — it does not run `speccy init` itself, and it
never blocks waiting to re-run it.

## When to use

Run once per project, right after the first `speccy init`. After
upgrading `speccy` and re-running `speccy init --force` (the CLI command
that refreshes the shipped skill files), re-run this skill to re-upsert
the `## Speccy conventions` section so your agents pick up refined rules.
The `## Product north star` section is written once and then left alone;
the conventions section is always re-upserted from the canonical
template.

## Steps

1. **Inspect `AGENTS.md` at the repo root and decide per-section.**
   `/speccy-bootstrap` seeds two independent sections — `## Product north
   star` and `## Speccy conventions` — per the AGENTS.md state matrix:
   north-star (present / absent) × conventions (present / absent),
   four cells.

   - **North star — absent.** Run the Q&A flow (step 2) and write
     the `## Product north star` section. Equivalent headings like
     `## Mission`, `## Product`, or `## Vision` count as present —
     do not duplicate.
   - **North star — present.** Skip the Q&A entirely. Confirm with
     the user that the existing content is current and continue
     without modification (freeze-on-first-write — the section
     carries user-authored prose that must not be stomped on
     re-run).
   - **Conventions — absent.** Append the canonical body (step 3).
   - **Conventions — present.** Replace the body verbatim (step 3).

   **Missing-file path.** When `AGENTS.md` is missing entirely
   (first init, or the user deleted it between invocations),
   re-bootstrap from scratch — run the Q&A and write a fresh file
   with both sections. Do not warn, refuse, or special-case "user
   deleted AGENTS.md after a prior init" as a regression; the skill
   silently re-bootstraps.

   The two seeding decisions are independent: the state of one
   section does not bias the treatment of the other. In particular,
   the conventions upsert (step 3) runs on every invocation
   regardless of whether the north-star Q&A ran or was skipped.
   Never overwrite `## Product north star` content; the conventions
   section is the only section the skill replaces in place.

2. **North-star adaptive flow (north-star absent).**
   Drive the `## Product north star` section as a brainstorm-style
   adaptive iteration over its five subsections in template order:
   opening prose (the project description and motivation paragraph),
   `### Users`, `### Minimal viable product`, `### Quality bar`, and
   `### Known unknowns`. Do not run a fixed question script.

   **Inspect the repo first.** Before asking the user anything, read
   the obvious context the working tree already carries: any
   top-level `README.md`, manifest files (`Cargo.toml`,
   `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.), the top-level
   source layout, and any prose already in `AGENTS.md`. Use the
   inspection to gauge per-subsection legibility — which of the five
   subsections you can plausibly draft from context, and which
   require eliciting answers from the user.

   **Per-subsection draft-or-Socratic decision.** Walk the five
   subsections in the documented order. For each one, decide
   independently:

   - **Legible from repo context → draft and confirm.** Draft the
     subsection from the inspected context and present it to the
     user for confirmation. Iterate on user redirects until the
     subsection is approved.
   - **Not legible → one-at-a-time Socratic Q&A.** Ask one question
     at a time. Prefer multiple-choice framings when the answer
     space is enumerable (e.g. "Is this primarily for: (a) solo
     developers, (b) a small team, (c) a public audience, (d)
     other — please describe?"); fall back to open prose only when
     enumeration genuinely doesn't fit. Iterate until the
     subsection is user-approved.

   These brainstorm-style patterns — one question at a time,
   multiple-choice when enumerable, draft-and-confirm, hard gate
   before write — are inlined here deliberately. Do not invoke
   `/speccy-brainstorm` or any other sub-skill from this path;
   `/speccy-bootstrap` stays self-contained.

   **Hard gate before write.** Do not write the `## Product north
   star` section to `AGENTS.md` until every one of the five
   subsections is explicitly user-approved. Partial drafts stay in
   the conversation; only the fully approved composition lands on
   disk. User redirects mid-iteration return to the relevant
   subsection rather than restarting the whole flow.

   When all five subsections are approved, compose them into the
   `## Product north star` section under the subheadings
   `### Users`, `### Minimal viable product`, `### Quality bar`, and
   `### Known unknowns`, with the opening prose at the section root.
   Non-goals belong as prose at the section root or under an
   optional `### Non-goals` subsection if they surfaced during
   iteration. Constraints should reference the project's existing
   `## Core principles` / `## Standard hygiene` if present.

3. **Upsert the `## Speccy conventions` section.** After the
   north-star step completes (whether the Q&A ran or was skipped),
   perform a deterministic upsert on the `## Speccy conventions`
   section using the heading boundary as the delimiter:

   - **Heading absent.** Append the canonical body (with its
     `## Speccy conventions` heading) to the end of `AGENTS.md`.
   - **Heading present.** Replace everything from the
     `## Speccy conventions` heading down to (but not including)
     the next top-level `##` heading — or to end of file if no
     subsequent top-level heading exists — with the canonical
     body. Content under sibling `##` headings (before or after
     the conventions section) is left byte-identical.

   The replace path runs on every invocation. There is no "section
   already matches canonical body, skip" optimization — the
   canonical body is rewritten verbatim every time so upstream
   prose refreshes propagate after a Speccy upgrade.

   The heading boundary is the sole delimiter. Do not introduce
   HTML comment markers (`<!-- speccy:conventions:start -->` or
   similar) to fence the region — the heading plus the preamble
   line inside the canonical body make the upsert contract
   visible without machine-readable markers.

   The canonical body is the literal content below, expanded from
   the shared reference module at render time:

   {% include "modules/references/agents-md-speccy-conventions.md" %}

   Use that body verbatim (heading and all) when writing or
   replacing the section. Do not paraphrase, reorder subsections,
   or add project-specific bullets — project-specific additions
   belong in a sibling section per the preamble line.

4. **Report.** Tell the user which `AGENTS.md` sections were
   written or refreshed: the north star (written fresh, or
   confirmed-existing and left untouched) and the conventions
   section (appended or replaced in place).

5. **Suggest the next step.** `{{ cmd_prefix }}speccy-plan` to draft the first
   SPEC slice from the now-populated north star.

This recipe does not loop. The bootstrap runs once; on re-run (after a
`speccy init --force` refresh of the shipped skill files) it only
re-upserts the `## Speccy conventions` section. The `## Product north
star` section is never overwritten once written.
