<!-- Shared self-review core for plan + amend; supersedes SPEC-0034 DEC-001 (lists stabilized → extracted). Brainstorm's pre-check is intentionally separate. -->

   **Mechanical/semantic split.** Mechanical issues are
   string-matchable from the SPEC.md text: `TBD`/`TODO` strings,
   "and"/"also" inside `<requirement>` blocks, untouched `<...>`
   template placeholders, missing alpha-prefix ordinals in
   `## Open Questions`. Fix mechanical issues inline by editing
   SPEC.md — do not write anything to `## Open Questions` or to
   chat. If judging requires reading semantics, it is semantic.

   Semantic issues surface as a row appended to `## Open Questions`
   using this fixed template string verbatim:

   `- [ ] {ordinal}. **Self-review caught:** {issue}`

   where `{ordinal}` is the next free alpha-prefix letter continuing
   any existing sequence, and `{issue}` is a one-line description of
   the problem. Do not substitute freeform prose.

   **The check properties:**

   - **Routing fidelity.** Brainstorm artifacts landed in the
     correct SPEC.md sections: restated ask → Summary +
     Requirements; assumptions → `<assumptions>`; open questions →
     `## Open Questions`; rejected framings → `## Notes` or
     `<decision>` blocks. This check applies only when brainstorm
     ran for this SPEC. When brainstorm was skipped, scope-traces
     alone covers the equivalent verification against the user's
     stated ask.

   - **Atomization.** No `<requirement>` body contains "and"/"also"
     multi-outcome wording that implies two distinct verifiable
     outcomes in one requirement. A requirement that bundles two
     outcomes should be split.

   - **Scope-traces.** Every `<requirement>` traces to a brainstorm
     artifact or to the user's explicitly stated ask. Requirements
     that appeared without a visible source in the approved framing
     are scope creep.

   - **Internal consistency.** No contradictions exist across the
     goals, non-goals, requirements, and assumptions sections. A
     goal that a non-goal denies, or a requirement that violates an
     assumption, is an internal contradiction.

   - **Ambiguity.** No `<requirement>` wording is interpretable in
     two materially different ways that would lead to different
     implementations. If the requirement is ambiguous, surface it
     as a semantic issue.
