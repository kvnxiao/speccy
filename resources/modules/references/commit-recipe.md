## Shared commit recipe

This module is the single source of truth for how a skill turns a
just-written artifact into a git commit. It is pulled into each
callsite via `{% include "modules/references/commit-recipe.md" %}`;
there is no verbatim copy of this recipe in any individual skill body.

The caller supplies two — and only two — behaviour-varying parameters:

- **Staging breadth.** Either `git add -A` (stage everything in the
  working tree) or a narrow `git add <paths>` list (stage exactly the
  named paths, leaving unrelated dirty paths untouched). The caller's
  prose states which form applies and why.
- **Title and body.** The commit message title line and body, built by
  the caller from its own artifact (e.g. a `[SPEC-NNNN]:`-prefixed
  title and a body drawn from the artifact's frontmatter or journal).

Everything else — the no-git short-circuit, the idempotency check, the
trailer, and the HEREDOC mechanics — is identical for every caller and
is defined once here.

### No-git short-circuit

Before staging anything, check whether the working directory is inside
a git repository:

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
```

If this exits non-zero (the project is not a git repository), **skip
the entire commit step without erroring**. The just-written artifact is
left in place on disk; no commit is attempted and no git failure is
surfaced. This preserves Speccy's "works identically in any project
state" property for non-git projects.

### Stage, then skip-if-empty, then commit

When a git repository is present:

1. **Stage** using the caller's chosen breadth — `git add -A` or the
   narrow `git add <paths>` list. Staging unchanged content is a no-op,
   so a narrow caller may pass its full path set unconditionally
   regardless of whether some of those paths were already committed.

2. **Idempotency check** — run the single unified form:

   ```bash
   git diff --cached --quiet
   ```

   If exit code is 0 (nothing staged), **skip the commit silently** —
   the configured paths are already committed at their current content.
   No surface to the user, no error. This is the only idempotency
   check; do not substitute a pre-stage `git status --porcelain`
   variant. If exit code is non-zero, proceed to the commit.

3. **Commit** with the caller's title and body, passing the message via
   a HEREDOC so newlines and any special characters survive verbatim:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <caller title>

   <caller body>

   Co-Authored-By: <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

   The commit is single-parent (parent count = 1). The skill body does
   not check or change the current git branch; the commit lands on
   whatever HEAD is.

### Trailer

The `Co-Authored-By` trailer is resolved by the identity-sourcing rule,
not restated here:

{% include "modules/references/identity-sourcing.md" %}

Apply that rule to fill the `<model>` segment of the trailer line. When
the host states no resolved identifier in-context, use the documented
fallback string
`Co-Authored-By: Speccy Skill Pack <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
