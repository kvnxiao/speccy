The CLI owns the appended block's `date`, `round`, and open/close
tags, plus the journal's frontmatter and sectioning. **Do not
compute, supply, or hand-author any of them** — there is no override
flag; the body you pipe on stdin is the inner text only. Validation
runs before any write, so a malformed body leaves the journal
byte-identical.
