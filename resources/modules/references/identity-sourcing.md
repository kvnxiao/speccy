## Sourcing your recorded identity

Build the `model="..."` value from two independently sourced parts;
never infer either from the skill-pack name, the persona name, or an
inherited environment variable.

- **Model segment** — the resolved long-form identifier your host
  states in-context (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8[1m]`), transcribed
  verbatim: keep the host's version punctuation (`claude-opus-4-8`,
  never `claude-opus-4.8`), never substitute a configured alias.
  When the host states no resolved identifier in-context, fall back
  to the `model:` value in your own agent definition file.
- **Effort suffix** — when the host exposes a reasoning-effort knob,
  read it from your own definition file (`effort:` on Claude Code,
  `model_reasoning_effort` on Codex) and append it as a slash-suffix
  (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8[1m]/low`); never read it from a runtime
  env override. A host with no effort knob omits the suffix
  entirely.
